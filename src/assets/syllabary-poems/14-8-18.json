{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Purveyors by appointment to the Peninsular Opium Boer Great Good and not quite Suez War\nThe Roslin Glen Gunpowder Mills had a tamped, mephitic rale,\nWalls thicker than Roslin Castle, fear of iron implements - \nEven its railway tracks were wooden:\nBanisters, toppled Scots pine, the ripped-out\nRail from Roslin Chapel.\nDray horses must have been slipper-shod,\nUnless they were wooden too:\nRocked by orphans cranking up some great, Midlothian\nConcatenation of silent carousels.\nSpring: the water rail paddles by;\nIt grunts and growls and rasps."}}
