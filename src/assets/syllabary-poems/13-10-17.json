{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I have seen a shrew apparently\nAsleep in the middle of the path\nAs it gave suck to a team of wasps.\nI've seen a dead antelope up a tree,\nBut never have I seen the little creatures impaled on thorns\nBy the shrike, the great grey shrike, the fiscal shrike."}}
