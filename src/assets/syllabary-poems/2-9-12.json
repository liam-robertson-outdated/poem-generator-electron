{"poem": {"title": "Commute", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The beasts! The foul\nIgnorant\nBeasts of the field. Mild\nBreists. The print\nOf beefs and hams\nOn grass. Beliefs,\nNot for ruminants, soothe\nEaters of meats\nObese in their briefs,\nTwo beats to the bar.\nBut a goat goes in for\nRooty beets and frosty grasses;\nIt bleats\nAs greens kellogulate\nAnd mists\nTurn over and go back to bleeps\nAlarm beeps sleep\nSnore the broker\nLost his breeks\nAnd doesn't know\nNothing but chickens have beaks."}}
