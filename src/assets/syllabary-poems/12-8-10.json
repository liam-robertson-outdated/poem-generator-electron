{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The jade that starts out\nJailed in rock is freed\nLike a newborn,\nLight pouring out of its eyes\nFrom who knows where\n\nBut life gets chopped and changed, holyoak.\nIt's chained and hauled across the park\nAnd chaired in Francis Bacon's pope\nA pile of breath, a bonefire."}}
