{"poem": {"title": "Esser di certo dei pazzo solenne", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ariosto! Conkers played on chestnut horses\nWith jute antimacassars, blazoned silk\nAnd mizzen-mast or telegraph-pole lances\nCouched for the joust. And they're off! No late career\nAs press-box pundit for the also-rans\nWho thought they'd duped the bard and jouked the point:\nJuiced inside that armour hardly separable for scrap."}}
