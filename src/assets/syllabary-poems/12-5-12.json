{"poem": {"title": "Prosody", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The jack's in its canton\nSome chaps are on deck\nTheir chat's given way to the wind.\nNow if under my hand, these charts\nwere to pin down the feathermost\nWhorls of its breath\nIf shoreline and sea took to the roads\nWould chance steer the boat?\nI think not."}}
