{"poem": {"title": "Church on the River Nerl 1981", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The film is cockroach brittle, this print\nHas tints of the sink it slid from,\nVitreous china sky, like my little eye,\nAwash with floaters.\nYet I've spent this night firm planted\nLike fishermen that day\nCorkscrew drill and hip flask, hunched\nEvangelists.\nWhat I saw there was a share of perpetual light\nAnd absent faces that\nGaze through my soul with eyes of stone."}}
