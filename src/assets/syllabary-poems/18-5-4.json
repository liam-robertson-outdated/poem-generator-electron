{"poem": {"title": "Hamartia", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ham in his hammock\nNext to Noah.\n\"What's a hamadryad, dad?\"\n\"No-one opens that crate:\nNot now, not never!\"\n\nWhat would you have done?\n\nThe snake escaped to India,\nThe ape regressed to the Great Rift Valley.\nShe, when they cut the tree down,\nShe died. It's as simple as this:\nNo harm, no harmony."}}
