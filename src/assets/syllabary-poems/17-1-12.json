{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Too many cooks wring clarty dish-cloots into the Cullen skink\nAnd stir-fry squid in printshop sauce. Too many coots get billed as duck.\nWho counts the strain on company croups? The poulterer,\nLord of the coops who sources chicken feed in kitchen cowps?\nUnlikely. One of those middle-management crooks that clouts his weans at table?\nNeither."}}
