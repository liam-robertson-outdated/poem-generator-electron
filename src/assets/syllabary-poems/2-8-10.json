{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A braid of water\nBared rock where the dell\nBathed in glacier milk,\nBig toe stuck in the tap,\nBailed out. Steep,\nThe reaper's blade still worked;\nhe baled lucerne and bellflowers.\nHe'd have brained\nWolves that bayed by night at signs,\nThe donkey, twixt two ricks of hay,\nThat brayed by day. It's\nWell seen he was grim. So much\nFor a game of sodjers. Really:\nIt rained on his braised brisket\nOnce too much. He raved and\nFrothed at the gob. Blazed\nHotter than his barbecue,\nWhich he lamed,\nKicking a leg off.\nBlared about r\u00e9gime change\nWait a bit, though: he IS\nR\u00e9gime. So raised his game,\nBraved his maker,\nLazed in shade all summer\nLet things live a bit and blamed\nThat self-compiling palimpsest,\nThe laird."}}
