{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "To equate the correcting of lies with censorship\nIs the work of a corrupted mind. Anscombe\nAnd Dante both are pitiless\nOn those who've lost the good of the intellect.\nThere's one, afraid of me for years, is now emboldened.\nA crisis looms: he believes he's a good man -\nNo smoke no drink no fuck the pretty women he\nRecruits to do the dirty while he travels\nHow he flies on company time! But he wants me dead\nAnd his boss has told him do it.\nThe crisis of course is mine: shun evil -\nI've never felt its deranging effects\nClose up before. Nor am I sure this structure\nCan both capture and withstand it."}}
