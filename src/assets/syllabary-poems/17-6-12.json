{"poem": {"title": "Quince Jelly and a Packet of Crisps", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Quirks of Squatland\nQuiffs of fall, sheer\nNumbdom. Call it quits.\nKilts and quilts and travelling rugs\nOn troubling clits, it's\nLazing on a sunny\nAfternoon to get my kicks in catnaps.\n\nStood there seeing our shoes\nFour canvas shoes at the London bus stop.\nThe smaller toes turn in, the heels\nLift as ae fond peck she puts\nTo the puckered brow.\nYesterday, on the internet,\nI found she'd married a\nHotshot lawyer twenty-five\nYears ago."}}
