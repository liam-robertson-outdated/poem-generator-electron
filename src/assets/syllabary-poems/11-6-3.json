{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Everything you apprehend\nIs a prisoner made to strip\nAnd be\nA given sign\nIn a given cell.\nSip and hold\nIn tongue and palate\nSkip the talk\nAnd skimp on thinking\nTill it sink in.\nLeafs'll scrimp\nThe rain. They won't let dab,\nThey won't let slip. Till\nA casual snip or the careful\nScrip of drapers shears\nCut to fit. Cut you to fit."}}
