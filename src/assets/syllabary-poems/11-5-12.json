{"poem": {"title": "Justice and Police (embossed on a man-hole cover)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "An ant lays down a track\nOn ivory straths and ebony scarps\nSprats in a tin were never as tight\nAs the parallel wires arranged by gauge\nOn a rack in the camel's coffin\nYet the sound technician loops and stacks\nHis cables: a teenage bedroom,\nBad day on a flip chart.\nThe bassist slaps and claws at it\nLike he didn't know straps have hooks.\nJacques steps up and spanks the keyboard.\nThe box snaps back. He rubs its body, smacks it. This\nGets out of hand. The drummer stamps\nAnd saps a speaker, scraps with the bassist\nWho scalps a hi-hat. Though reduced to slats\nThe Strat is quite an ax. The scamps\nWhose manners music sweetens aren't\nHelping with the crime stats.\nIn all this, where's the sax? Backstage\nHe scarfs up chemical snacks till his slacks\nAre tight as his embouchure.\nThe impresario slants in -\nComical spats and outsize puro -\n'You're all fired', he snaps\nBut the iron stanks to an ancient\nCistern underneath the cellar\nServed as gongs in the last performance.\nSplat's the word, or splop, perhaps,\nTo put the lid on it."}}
