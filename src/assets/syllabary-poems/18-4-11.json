{"poem": {"title": "For Autumn", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Still hubs, the trees turn\nAs September hulls, for instance,\nConkers heaped in pyramids by Huns\nAnd hunter-gardeners. Now one of them\nHugs his petrol chanter,  that\nHums out of tune and hurls leaves at nothing.\nWhat's his is mine.\nWhat's mine is hers."}}
