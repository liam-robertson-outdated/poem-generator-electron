{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The hurst was a shoal on the river of time,\nA knoll in the tangle of space;\nThe hurt was mortal. The hut was not\nThat place of hushed\nResonance, a piano's ribcage,\nBut a clearing hulked and hunched with branches\nPleached as lovers' arms might be,\nWhere the two of them humped and huffed.\nAnd the hunt was on."}}
