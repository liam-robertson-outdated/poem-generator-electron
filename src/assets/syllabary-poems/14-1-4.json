{"poem": {"title": "A Dacha near Leningrad", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A shaft of stone\nWith a liquid lens\nSorceress\nWhat do you see\nIn the well of the stone\nIn the stone of the well?\nWild swans.\nA day on the dacha\nQuartered together\nUnder the heat.\nCircle the horizon. Look!\nExclamatory puffs of smoke\nFor pines and birches.\nA wooden trap in the smoky trees.\nLift the stone, open the door:\nCold bright darkness facing up\nThrough the flattening heat.\nIn the well of the woods\nIn the woods of the well\nMister seer, what do you see?\nA quiet ward of rheumy-eyed\nExpectorating old men watching\nThe television's lovely face.\nA low serai on December dunes.\nGo to the glass meniscus, see\nA room with a lamp and a stove and a cat\nAnd the four of us in company\nIn the plumb of the snows\nIn the vertical winter."}}
