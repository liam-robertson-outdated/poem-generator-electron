{"poem": {"title": "Cape Sounion", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Purulent itch,\nA boil - first\nIn the army of angels ejecting from sleep\nThe broil of the living, this biological brawl.\nSome army; odd angels, come to that,\nThat bawl and clamour.\nThe pluke lifts clear of the surface, a hot\nBronze ball, by some accounts.\nWhat the heck. Let's raise\nA shrine to the god of the fishes."}}
