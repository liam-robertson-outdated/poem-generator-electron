{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If history is written by the winners\nIt is understood by the losers\nEvicted from history\nAs a house is robbed of its stones,\nWood of trees and vice versa.\nThe wound is a precious gift, whose donor\nKnows what it's for; the doctor\nSees what it does. Neither\nGets it, nor would take it."}}
