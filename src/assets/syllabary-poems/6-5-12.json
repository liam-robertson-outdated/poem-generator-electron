{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You want to send a farce on tour,\nYou have to pack and package it:\nProps and pranks, airholes. A deck-hand\nFaffs with tape and string.\nThe flaps won't meet. The postman\nFranks a bulge, that farts at him. Take two.\nThe player fasts, subsists on two plain facts\nWashed down with flasks of fennel tea ad lib.\nThe cast now fits, their flanks are skinny;\nStill, no fat's no fun - ask Julius C.\nBut this, now, this plays out in council\nFlats and schemes, in grand apartments.\nWork it up from Morse,\nFrom a one-dimensional fax."}}
