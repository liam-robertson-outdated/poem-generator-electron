{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "All dit and no dah, the robin is\nOne fearsome featherweight. Remorse? Not a whit of it.\nBy dint and by drift its eyes have dipped\nTo where most folk keep their ears:\nIt's got a head like a squid.\nAs season after season dripped,\nDished out rosettes and ditched them, Robin\nStood by the path, chest out, expecting\nThe L\u00e9gion d'honneur."}}
