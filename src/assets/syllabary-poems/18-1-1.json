{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Who was it? And how?\n- Three wee kings:\nSaid they're made of tar;\nA messenger called Hugh\nWith a flat-top guitar;\nHew Wood and Drew Water,\nLooking lost as their sheep.\nHuddle up to the kye, it's cauld!\nPoor baby: lips trembling blue,\nThe hue of her cry."}}
