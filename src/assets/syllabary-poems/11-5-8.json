{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A trail of scran to bring it back?\nTo bring US back. It didn't scan,\nThere's dialect or slang I didn't get,\nThe odd spang of pride hid hardly\nAnd just an octave span!\nSuch small wings, they seemed to throb.\nShe sang, it took off, sprang into sound,\nCircled once and gone."}}
