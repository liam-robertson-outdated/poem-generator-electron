{"poem": {"title": "\"First, We Take Manhattan\" - Leonard Cohen", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "'They sentenced me to twenty years of stardom'\nSaid the system\n'For snorting all their weapons-grade cocaine'.\nPassengers in the cage\nOf a high-velocity elevator\nDisappearing up some tower's nostril\nAttempt to break glass over switch\nMarked STRUCTURAL REFORM and find it's armored.\nPARODY we've pushed; now what does JEOPARDY entail?\nThe tower has been hijacked\nBy well-connected men."}}
