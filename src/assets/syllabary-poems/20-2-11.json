{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Mid-Atlantic lows, pelagic\nViolence weighed and wanting.\nSwell that rises like the word 'loathes',\nA raft of guillemots on its back.\nOn loans and slipways cobbled and slicked with\nGranite loaves and fishguts\nHe checks the lobes of his anchor,\nLoads this and lowers that."}}
