{"poem": {"title": "Close but no", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Was it the way the slub silk\nWing of that kimono\nHapped my face\nAs she stuck some beer in a glass,\nThe definite hip against my arm,\nMade one diner smirk, the other\nDon't say sulk but stiffen,\nBrought back the dentist's help in candid cotton, so intent\nOn viewing the fine spelunker's progress down my root canal\nShe put her right breast to my left ear?\nI near hoped they struck necrosis, not to notice\nOne self-inflating life-raft had commenced emergency drill.\nEncore to surfing Berlusconi's box at 2 a.m.\nA second each for sixty channels.\nIn the high fifties a dame in her forties\nBeachwear kissed a woman half her age.\nIn the time it took Matt Damon to clean up the CIA,\nNeither had so much as opened their mouth,\nThe younger one still dressed up warm. In the land of suck\nTheir screen was spattered with ads for services\nFrom that skunk syllable, whose users skulk,\nWhere they snuck and slunk to relieve themselves\nOf salt and semen. Two goals into a league game\nThey still snog like adolescents.\nThen one enjoys the other's breasts, in spite\nOf the daunting camera. Enough:\nIt must be love."}}
