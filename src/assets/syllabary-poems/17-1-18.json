{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Monkshood, eh? Well you can keep your cowl\nAnd give me an Argive helmet, with the head in,\nFlayed and mogrified to larkspur spikes.\nLycoctonon, we'll call him, winter wolfsbane.\nA totem pole of him and all his troupe,\nA tower of docking stations for the bees,\nCatspaw the wise old monkey used\nTo pull his chestnuts out the purple coals."}}
