{"poem": {"title": "Passing Out", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Another blade another blonde\nThe hero balled a government bond, em-\nBroiled in white-tie fisticuffs.\nThey brawled in broad\nAgreement as to rules\nThey bobbed and wove. When biffed\nOne neither bawled nor sniffled. Yet\nNot bogged in protocol, when bombed, well,\nBig boys' rules, what? Not so much hard-\nBoiled as armour plated (with a 'u'). Although\nYour tires are bald, old chap. A flat\nMight land a bod in shit."}}
