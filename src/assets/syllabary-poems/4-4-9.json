{"poem": {"title": "Manhattan", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Bushy smoke-blond halo mussed\nOn a Japanese cartoon madonna -\nOne of those quantum states:\nAll energy's accounted for\nBut not all the accounts are.\nThe sun must float. The rest\nAs a purblind mutt will come to must;\nThe people that lives on darkness\nHas put out the light."}}
