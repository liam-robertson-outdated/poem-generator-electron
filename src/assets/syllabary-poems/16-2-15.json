{"poem": {"title": "A Golden Treasury of Multiverses", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Frailty was the initial fear: the weakest link\nMight fail the chain of sense. But this was a web,\nChainmail, more like; a toil of strategies that prevailed.\nPrevailed? They outstripped Napier's apocalyptic longing,\nTo rubble the Richter scale of Richter scales. But\nEvery virtuality needs a toe-hold in the vicious earth,\nAnd every need begets a law. Here - reason, as in ration\nOr perish. Some did. One web realtor took this heuristic:\nRetain whatever utterance can't translate to or from English,\nAnd every word that etymology can't reduce -\n\"gore\", for instance\"; \"mardi\", which isn't \"Thursday\".\nThese are the primes of language, the lauds of number.\nThe server - their perishable emblem - might be\nA broken pier, a rig sunk in the bits it drilled for. Any\nRuin fit for haunting, any sturdy poem\nTo track the sun, to gauge its motor."}}
