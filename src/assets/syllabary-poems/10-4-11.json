{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "P", "text": "Dumb's the word\nIn winter duds\nThat duns darkling streets for sense\nOysters on crushed ice, chestnuts on coals,\nWally dugs jitterbug on hearths as lorries pass.\nFun drugs for some, prescription for all,\nBut tons of it: neurochemical talking drums\nWhose dull word drubs dissent.\nThis market is real and the war is screen-deep, dumbskull.\nYou want that reversed? It overdubs your exospeak\nTill we're doves on a wire at Tahir Square, a little christmas\nBow on our beaks: a doo does what a doo does. Sing:\nA doo does what a doo does."}}
