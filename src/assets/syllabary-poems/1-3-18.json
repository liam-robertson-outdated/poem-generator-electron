{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The man who made billions on\nFutures in cod-liver, corn and shale oil\nDoesn't know how to get rid of them. Scram!\nGo away! But the millions\nAnd billions all crowd round his bed in the gloom.\nOut on the road, there's a journeyman singing\n\"Little bone burin, my awl, my skill\"."}}
