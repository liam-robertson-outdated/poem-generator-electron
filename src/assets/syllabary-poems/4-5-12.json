{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Max is the man.\nHe invented the mass.\nHe keeps his goods in masks, and yet\nHe marks them just in case\nSome pieces of eight or pieces of ass\nShow up at marts on the dark web\nLashed to cell-phone masts,\nPinned to prayer mats.\nThe maths of his scheme is simple:\nLast in pays the plain-clothes\nMen in macs. Every week, new\nMaps get shaken out and tucked in."}}
