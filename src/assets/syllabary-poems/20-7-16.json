{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Leaving work, \"my mind bruised with it\"\nI thought to write, but that\nIs a symptom, not description,\nOf bruising of the spirit in bureaucracy,\nConfined to its ineptitudes, and one of them,\nAs a bruise on the leg disfigures in disabling.\nAll that adrenaline and no one to thump.\nAll that testosterone, and who were those\nDarkling women with the rusty hair?\nMother and child? Though in the daughter's brow\nThe genes gave way to geometry.\nThat tawny tawse, I could feel it in my hand -\nConflation of the French toison\nWith punishment for thinking o't. Go home."}}
