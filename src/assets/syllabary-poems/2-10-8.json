{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If we did weep buckets\nThe brine could be used\nTo deal with cholera.\nShow films of suffering babies\nSend the viewers' tears to treat them\nOr convert to cash at a rate that buys\nAs much physiological solution locally.\nYou could use the buckets of tears for cooking rice."}}
