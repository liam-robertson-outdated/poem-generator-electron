{"poem": {"title": "Deuce", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Beat your brother while he's drunk,\nSaid Time to himself and the corky nipples\nOf his sister-in-law that rendered\nWine not milk. He wondered at\nCapillaries that sucked on crusty\nNodules in the substrate, gnats\nWithout a warning when his brother\nBanjoed him back."}}
