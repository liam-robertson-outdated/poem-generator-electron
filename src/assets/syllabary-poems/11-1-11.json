{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "My Bentley slews on gravel\nSomebody spews out the off side\nPuke strews the roses\nThe steering screws to full lock, which rather\nSkews the apprehension of oncoming trees.\nAh well. The driver sues for peace with the police\nThen scours his cell and sours in custardy,\nHis just desserts. Yet stounds of pain\nAnd nightly sounds of non-consensual sex:\nWho ordered that? It was only a motor.\nThe sloughs our penal system stows\nThe righteous sows that run it.\nThe scows of State: big dirty barges in the night\nTheir honoured scowls and schools of thought,\nThe bar stools on the bridge.\nDad brings the cin\u00e9, mum forgets the spools\nAgain. She soothes and consoles him\nBut near enough swoons when the boss shows up.\nAs all attention zooms, I've seen\nZoos with visitors more discreet."}}
