{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Since you return to her, as happy as\nRoebuck to a pond in the summer heat,\nYou have to woo her.\nNow every synapse swings you down\nThat unexpected road to Rome,\nShe must respond.\nFrom any state of play it's mate\nIn two moves now, unless\nYou speak to her!"}}
