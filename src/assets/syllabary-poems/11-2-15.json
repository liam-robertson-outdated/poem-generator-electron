{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "With every sore a shiny lens\nA pulpit for the nerve ends\nThe punters snore and snort a Christmas-\nCracker spore or two to share.\nWhy store up riches? What's the score?\nAnother viral ploy to ex-\nPlore. The sower's open hand as floaters soar.\nThe species now accelerates.\nThe specimens get slower."}}
