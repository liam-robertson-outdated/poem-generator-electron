{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "There's no biz like po biz,\nBins of sludge and bings of\nMethane-haunted solid waste\nAs evening brings the craws hame\nThe system brims: brigs\nAre up to their tantalizing bilges,\nJudges need their bibs.\nPreening with rigid bills on calls to tender\nThe winner builds his jails before he bids."}}
