{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I was swaddled in satin and held over the font.\nA hand emerging from a surplice and soutane held up\nA sugar cube absorbing sunlight yellow.\nJags and sacraments punctuated childhood.\nThe worst was the BCG, that stood for\nRitual circumcision, the scar\nThrough which we flinched into adolescence.\nA jag was also the midnight blue saloon the polis drove.\nAnd it seemed there was a big cat called a jaguar\nBecause it was the same colour\nAnd it ran just as fast\nAnd it had claws like syringes."}}
