{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You'll see its signature migrant V in scum\nHear it strum disoxygenated wavelets;\nScrum on the two-plank jetty\nBuilt like a pit latrine, the slum\nYou squirm at the thought of falling in;\nWho'd have swum or crawled across it?\nIn sum: the picturesque."}}
