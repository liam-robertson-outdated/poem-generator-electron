{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It rained on the paddocks, the paddies and lazybeds. They\nRailed against their betters, raised their kids against the taxes and got on with it.\nI reigned supreme, a dry\nMartini in the sceptre hand\nRippled as my generals\nRaged at their subordinates, who raved with less\nConviction at the cavalry, unruffled,\nThat reined aside and ranged so wide and far\nThey had to stage the occasional raid to augment their rations."}}
