{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A sourcerer sourced the ingredients by appointment;\nThe boys bought stuff in a shop. The needy\nSupport the posh, who sell it back to them.\nSo it goes. You spoiled the ballot tender and sloped off.\nBut things do change: some chitinous feelers went wi-fi,\nAnd there was light the critters scoped and got to flee.\nTran made room for sport; the gods had fun:\nOne soaped the shirts he'd soaked in a big tin\nBasin, the range stoked up, to stoat them off the washboard;\nOne, discretely soaped, soaked in a pool that all but\nSmoked on the snowy ledge. The beauty of the landscape\nSmote her brow. A weasel collar\nStroked her cheek."}}
