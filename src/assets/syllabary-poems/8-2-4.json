{"poem": {"title": "Paracelsus", "author": null, "text": "Pygmy, gnome - the name was immaterial\nTo bubbles of the earth they navigated,\nMelancholic getters of gold and silver. Listen\nTo how they cough and what they tell you,\nMiners, smelters. Thousands of years they died their evil death;\nWhat doctor or philosopher among you, till him,\nKnew where your coin was from or sounded airways\nPlated with metal smoke?"}}
