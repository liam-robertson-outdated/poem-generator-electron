{"poem": {"title": "Occupation", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A sudden, probing silence\nFrom the table next to ours\nEchoes along Argyll Street.\nCat got your tongue, gents?\nGet back to base. Yes,\nBefore you acquired that Powell drawl\nAnd a taste for local seafood\nOur mum made soup and scones\nFor the Faslane Peace Camp.\nWe'll see the back of youse yet."}}
