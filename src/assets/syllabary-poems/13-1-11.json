{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Canal bridges tighten the laces of its shoes\nThe damp ingredient in eel or stockfish or canvas stews.\nSecrets of the kitchen and the court:\nThe duke hunts rodents with a mallet.\nGreat divots out of the sea turf.\nAt least one shrew's died of fright in the autumn showers,\nIts little coat fit for a Faberg\u00e9 charity shop."}}
