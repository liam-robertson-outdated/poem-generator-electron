{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A knife can do division and subtraction.\nWhere there's life\nA seer will see a sign\nA spear can find the usual\nSmear of proteins\nA fuss about nothing\nThe sneer of the blade\nIn human relations\nYou men of vision - women too -\nBig gondoliers who steer your statecraft\nThrough the sphere of spin\nHere I salute you.\nHoi!"}}
