<text>On judo mat in splats of sweat
He marked out the crimectomy
His spanking partner matched with fifties facts
And in they marched, or slunk.
A false flag sidled up the mast
As sanction busters maxed out on the bull mart.
But time is a matte black stealth mobile,
An armoured Zil that stretches as he sits in back, unmasked,
The bowl of  poison-tested mashed potato
Sliding out of reach
And all that extra leg room.
All those clever gadgets massed on frontiers:
We went too far, perhaps not far enough.
He says he knows where I live;
Heâ€™s marked the launch codes on his cuff.
