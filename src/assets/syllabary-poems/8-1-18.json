{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "First it's a pole for shinning up and down\nWith notches\nThen flat steps slotted in slanting round:\nIt's a proper newel, not for long; \nEach fan treat soon includes its slice of the cylinder\nThe newel's then a structured space in a helical flight\nThe binned nowel of an inside mould,\nIts message so carefully erased."}}
