{"poem": {"title": "The Way of the Words, for Nicolas Bouvier", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A wilderness is music on deaf ears.\nThat Persian city, Persepolis,\nWhere fire sang in Zoroaster's bones,\nHas clogged the carburettor. Entropy.\nZend Avesta, if I've got it right,\nWas like Sanskrit in some Aramaic script.\nZain was the letter zed, a word for weapon;\nThen Marco Polo and three wise men,\nNow Parsee in the Arabic alphabet. I can't keep up.\nShiraz! Where are those flasks of throaty wine\nYou used to do? The stuff we stained your rugs with?\nAnd what has become of those subtle women\nWho wouldn't take the veil? Omar Khayyam!\nSuch music in a wilful wilderness."}}
