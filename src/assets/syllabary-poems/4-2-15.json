{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The green  going down to the pond got trimmed\nWith this cast-iron mower.\nSkipping-rope handles, clutch and toy brake\nAnd a diesel more like for a car\nOr an army submersible, instead of that\nBig concrete roller. I told him,\nI did: if it runs away don't\nBrake. Slip the clutch, swing it round.\nDid I say 'submersible'?\nFreudian slip."}}
