{"poem": {"title": "A Night an the Opera", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Stamp on the pedal. Soft white pelts the screen, a press\nOf household pets and furry pests: you've crashed the cloakroom.\nLeave the hatcheck 50 pence, keys in the ignition.\nPerps on the door are quick to seize\nSuch perks to their condition:\nPecks on the cheek for the gift of a real\nMink coat. With skidmarks."}}
