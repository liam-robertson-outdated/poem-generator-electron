{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It was maybe the only ornament\nThat wasn't a family photo or religious\nOr both. Sea urchin, unborn wedding china,\nOutsailor of death, grey ranting surf\nAnd three pape generations\nTo light on my bomb-shelter door till tonight.\nMy mum would pick it up and look at it\nAnd put it back."}}
