{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The smack of burning flesh unfurled\nThe stack of sandbags dwindled.\nHow we stank!\nAnd that lang swack o watter,\nSlack-jawed and still in his livery\nSank without flotsam.\nVisitors snack in the engines\nThe sac that fuelled our malice is lanced.\nNow seduction is stark as a writ.\nYou want someone to sack."}}
