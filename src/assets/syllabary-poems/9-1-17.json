{"poem": {"title": "Daphne and Apollo", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Buonaparte got from his brother-in-law\nA Louvre load of statuary.\nWho was it took my daughters' shades and adolescent finery?\n- the cameras, CD players, music, phone, passports and holiday cash,\nThe Dante, Milton, Joyce;\nTwo weeks pay at least gone down\nWith shares in children's memories\nWhile we were in the Villa Borghese\nAs the god caught up with her\nAnd the look on their face as the lymph in her took hold\nAnd the laurel tree consumed her\nAnd Napoleon's sister sat next door."}}
