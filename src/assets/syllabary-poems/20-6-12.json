{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The lissome lynx\nIn the animal hospital\nLimps, of course,\nTo keep its cover.\nIt's my liths, doctor,\nIt lists and lisps its ills.\nBut as the chubby children pass, it lilts,\nIts neck lifts, the lints\nOn the tufty tip of its ears\nPrick up. It licks its lips."}}
