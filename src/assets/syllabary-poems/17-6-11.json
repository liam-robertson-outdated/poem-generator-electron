{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Cool porcelain from kilns\nWhere tradition cleaves and clings to fire\nKings can wield like a flensing knife\nUntil their right hand lose its skill\nAnd power gets counted in kills,\nKids' throats slit and cribs left empty\nFor real or imagined slights."}}
