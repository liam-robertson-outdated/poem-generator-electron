{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "One aborts or rapes and stones its women\nA second flogs and hangs them for converting to a third\nWhose holy nuns so loathe the lovechild that\nEight hundred little corpses are dumped in a septic tank.\nThe word and the bourn and the blackbird's song.\nExonerated - the burden being love - \nBorne out on a burning updraught\nCould it all be redeemed? Could time\nSkin, brain and bone the cussed structures?\nThe word and the bourn and the blackbird's song.\nAn interdict: the drum unstruck\nThe fossil flute not blown, no bound or sentence.\nBirdsong and silence."}}
