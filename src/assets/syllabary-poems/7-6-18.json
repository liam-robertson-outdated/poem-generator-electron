{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Can't Buy a Thrill\nNow let's consider, for the sake of argument,\nSince you're an argumentative little rotter,\nThat greying men have their corny sensitivities\nAnd you're not the prosecution, but my daughter.\nObjection! Sustained. But would you hear me through?\n\"Afraid of living\" - that's your latest taunt,\nAnd I think - but didn't I help them feel at home\nBy hacking down my sweet or bloody wants?\nOr was that just me appeasing Holy Rome?\nI've flourished in love, and I've wished I was dead,\nAnd I've broken the rules that held me together.\nAnd oddly enough, I'm still here. I look round:\nIn spite of it all, I fear nothing and no one.\nIf I'm alive, it's in my fear for you."}}
