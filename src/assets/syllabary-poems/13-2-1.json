Funny smell.\nOpens the bonnet and the manual.\nNothing obvious, old bit of rubber,\nPuts it in the glove box.\nCar won't start. She freewheels\nDown the hill, and there's a garage.\nMechanic looks. She asks him what's up.\nIt's your fan belt.\n\t\tYes?\nYou huvnae got wan.\n\t\t\tOh!\n(She goes to show him) Is that it?\nAye,\nBut it's no whaur it's usually kept."}}
