{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Kitchen. One\nRedds the table backhand and\nHunches to arm-wrestle scrawl.\nStorm revs up, set to\nThrottle some cherry tree; good.\nSubliminal realms and diets; zombie reds\nPop nails in boards and beds. Awake\nAnd scurry round, furry wrens on ruled leaf."}}
