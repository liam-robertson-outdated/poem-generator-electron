{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Bees knocked off course in beams of wind. Motes\nBumble in light that breathes on glass\nAnd rubs it. A bright breeze focuses,\nIntones its three-day breves, one for every wood,\nFor each field of beans, for the grass, its beards and javelins.\nTwo beers for every place we've seen the last of, liked or not!\nWhat though the bamboo's yet to sprout\nFor our biodegradable caskets.\nThe species breeds, the specimen bleeds.\nTime beads in the still."}}
