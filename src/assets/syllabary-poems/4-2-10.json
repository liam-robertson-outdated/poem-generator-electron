{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Your man's in fight or flight mode. Nod and smile.\n'Whether you can't or needn't, might or must is modal, here nor there.\nBut did or did you not, now that - '\nHe moaned a lot, did Moanalot. He mourned\nThe good old days before they cracked the mould\nAnd maimed him. When Sunday mowed the green."}}
