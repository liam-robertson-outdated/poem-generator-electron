{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The English child\nIs stiff and cold.\nChide it, put it away.\nWith R & R the language jived\nOr jibed, swung about. The needle\nGyred in its bubble.\nRhyme was downright.\nReason split and rhythm\nJined. What chimed in speech\nThe writer docked and jiled."}}
