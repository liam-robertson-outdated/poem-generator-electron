{"poem": {"title": "Rehab of Shakespeare", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Piano tones ... begin loud and bright\nand then decay to silence in a complex way\nthat's characteristic of the instrument.\n- Robert Moog, Byte 6, 1986\nMarrying clearest word to soundest verse\nAnd five reiterations of the burden\nRowed in fire and stone (like a pharaoh's curse),\nIntoned to last until the final Amen;\nAnd we can't make head nor tail of who the song's\nRegaling with its DECUS ET TUTAMEN.\nOur end is nigh indeed if verse among\nStunned sinners is recalled when doom is clapping;\nAbsorb and sift, time, shift all that we've done,\nRemit, maybe, a broken seal, Harappan\nInscription pan -ar ki(r), \"the singer's mark\",\nA thunderstone. Love doesn't fear the dark."}}
