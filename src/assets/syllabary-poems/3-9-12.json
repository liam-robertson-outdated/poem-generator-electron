{"poem": {"title": "I am Fed Up with Beautiful Women", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Gravity (patiently) pleats\nThe jungles. Burning peats\nRelate their ancient summers\nIncoherently.\nThis piece will not fare better.\n\nThere is nothing nonchalant about you.\nBrightness older than the hills\nFlares up in you,\nAnd you don't quite get it.\n\nNo peace between why not\nAnd why. You hold my glance\nAnd pierce the routine. It's time\nTo go. How grey the fierce\nFeast has made me.\n\nWhat peaks, what stars, what beauties\nWill just have to do without me.\nCommit this to verse,\nIt's a car-crusher requiem."}}
