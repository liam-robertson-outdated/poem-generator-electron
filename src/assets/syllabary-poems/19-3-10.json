{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A wad of greens in each ear\nA plug of twenties chewing in his cheek\nWalled in, he warred abroad.\nTime is linear but the line is whorled.\nThen again it breaks. I warned him\n(Read my lips). He\nhad that look of something\nwarmed once too often in the microwave.\nIn the private ward\nThey heard all about his magic wand."}}
