{"poem": {"title": "Cob", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A dusty red and rusty\nDead 1930s Norton\nIn the cellar\nBy the wine butt\nNext to me.\n\nA motor pump to draw ad lib\nOn an old artesian well.\n\nA Bluebottle throttles down on cobweb roads.\n\nKob was the one I picked on\nWhen the others picked on me.\nHe was timid; I was the pariah\nCollaborator clobbered in the pecking order\nEgged on by a chicken-necked solicitor.\n\nI didn't have much physical skill or\nThe toughness to match my temper\n(Which I still have trouble mastering).\nIt's still a football match\nWith neither goal nor referee."}}
