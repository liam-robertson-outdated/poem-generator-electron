{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Two tufty knobs of wax in buckled jamjar lids that lost the thread\nTo the pressure of thermodynamic noise just\nUnder knolls of cartilage.\nLight gnaws at silence. Every mind, every forest,\nEvery universe, for all I know - abandoned soon or late,\nNorms and standards with them\nLike a comb with just too many broken nogs."}}
