{"poem": {"title": "Coming into Her Estate", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "This one, found in the back of a wardrobe,\nScuttles and pings with hat pins, gnomic prynnes\nAnd pills for the prig's condition.\nThe silly besom's cracked two crystal\nPrisms trying to fit them in.\nOutside under the cork oak,\nWorth their weight and happy as,\nTen Vandal pigs, the colour of kelp."}}
