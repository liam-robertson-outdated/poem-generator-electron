{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You were faint, no, slight,\nShoal in a fall of silk\nWhen I opened a book in the loft\nPixels flaked and reconvened\nYou were fate, crocheted from nothing, no\nYou're not. That smile in the mirror\nIsn't faked. A defensive feint.\nProtect, since I'm not there to,\nThe freight, the value of your moment."}}
