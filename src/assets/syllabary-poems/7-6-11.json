{"poem": {"title": "LitCrit", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"An audience is oxygen to a poet, and the most effective\nway of showing your feelings is to deprive him of air\"\n- Rita Goldberg, Harvard University\n\nSome critics eat thristles\nFor gristle and grace\nBut the thirls of authority\nFrazzle them numb\nTo the thrills in things.\nAs their oxygen thins\nThey suffocate folk\nWho'd not stifle a yawn."}}
