{"poem": {"title": "Bebop", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ee ree reed creed screed scree sri see\nThe sea'd have receded if seeded with stone\nIf stoned and sere seared. What speed speared\nSteed steered. Sri Lingam (Holy Wullie) smeared\nWith butter sneered a prayer as something\nJuddered against the wall that screened him\nSeethed and screamed. He might have steeled himself\nAnd skiied to hell on all those drifts of seed that\nSeemed that seamed to powder off like chastened snaw, but naw.\nThe crystal Cree."}}
