{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Redd and set the table. Room and board\nFor seven strangers and their salt.\nThey rend and render bones you serve,\nRedden like they hadnae drank in weeks:\nThe rough red wine was a mistake\nYour neighbours will have read about\nOr winter's out."}}
