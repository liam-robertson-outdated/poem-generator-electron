{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A tough husk to crack\nBetween the tongue and teeth\nThe rights and rocks\nIntention, sense and sound\nInitial, vowel, end.\nRough, and done before you know it\nCaught before it's felt\nBut lose your touch\nAnd lose your say in things :\nYou dae wht yr tellt."}}
