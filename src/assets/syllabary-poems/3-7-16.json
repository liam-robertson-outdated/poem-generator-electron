{"poem": {"title": "Aengus, Again (for Marina Ramsay)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I wander till I'm wandert\nAnd she's a freckled shadow mapped\nOn a pool, and won't be guddled, much less\nCuddled, hazel glimmering. Rapt,\nThese fifty years, in her and on her,\nPlayed, till time and tides peg out,\nA cold contusion of the moon,\nA gold ring flung to catch a trout."}}
