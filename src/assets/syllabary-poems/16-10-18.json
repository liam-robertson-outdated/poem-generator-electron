{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If the grail is your goal,\nUse guile.\nDon't rile the ghoul,\nDon't guy the growler: gull them.\nEschew the grill,\nEat gruel.\nCradle the gall in your heart.\nLet the gale\nRock you like resentment.\nOf course, if it's the girl you're after\n- forget it."}}
