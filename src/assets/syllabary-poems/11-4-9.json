{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Well it is and it isn't\nNormal to get scrunched up\nThrough the floor,\nSloughed and coddled\nScuffed and soft\nHardly a gristle strut to your name\nIf any.\nAnd then you're \nStuffed in woollies. Really!\nSurfed the breast,\nYou sucked and slurped the magic\nToggle and slumped\nConsummate drunk\nTill opening time and supped again.\nKilling time you smirked and sulked.\nWhere is that slut? Ill manners\nCome with culture,\nGo with the scut of fear. Keep going\nTill you're stumped\nA duster snuffed."}}
