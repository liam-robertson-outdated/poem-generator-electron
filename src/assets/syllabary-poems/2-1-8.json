{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Half stricken\nBy an office canteen sometime roast\nToday re-het and dangerous half-chicken\nChomped without a thought\nWhile reading (I not it) a piece forgot\nBefore the wiping of the gob. All afternoon\nMy brains in brown-out, not to mention - as we should - \nThe institutional boon of low-cost catering,\nThe routine thrills and spills of what we take for food."}}
