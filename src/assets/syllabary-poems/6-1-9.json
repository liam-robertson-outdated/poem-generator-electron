{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Fluked in a fishtail gown, she flounced\nToward the dais through the frowst and crush.\nNot one to flout her foresight, she\nPut one foot on the bottom step\nAnd found the stitching stopped her.\nWasn't that just the glac\u00e9 fruit\nTo top a fount of Chantilly cream?\nAnd would one of those gigolos leave his\nChampagne flute and help her up?"}}
