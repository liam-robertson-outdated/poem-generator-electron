{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Gold is great. A wee slab in the sock drawer,\nA goad to get more. How they groaned\nAs it sedimented heart and lungs!\nBut they coughed up. It glowed,\nIt gored the dark.\nNo, you can't take it with you, but -\nA votive kirk, a fitba park -\nIt'll get you an upgrade."}}
