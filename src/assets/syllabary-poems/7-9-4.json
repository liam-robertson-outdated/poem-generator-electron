{"poem": {"title": "Loitering within Tent", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A damp and uncomfortable camping holiday\nArmy surplus tents. A couple of\nArmy surplus tenants tagged along\nAnd a jeep thrown in.\nYou invited us round for drinks\nJust the sweat and mildewed four of us. I thought no\nYet that carpeted sunlight, the welcome air\nAnd you in muslin - linen, surely?\nI caught the theme: rough canvas, hemp\nThen linen; underneath that - silk,\nThen what? You wore a hairband. When's\nThe last time you wore that? Till noon\nMendelssohn's big hit, clang clang like tinnitus.\nYou're not getting married, are you? Not again?"}}
