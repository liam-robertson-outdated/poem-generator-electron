{"poem": {"title": "Toad in a Thunderstorm", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Some kind of bloat-fish shat and boaked itself\nUp to the eyes in nothing to boast about;\nTremulous self-possession broached by thunder\nTries to bolt but, rather than lollop, totters, a pantomime fart:\nBad legs of two old men in high heels,\nAn upturned boat on top."}}
