{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Without its dental weirs, speech\nIs a wheeze, weeds in the lung, the\nTongue aa owre the place weaves\nEmpty spells, and nothing weans us\nInfants. But we're all right:\nWeals of rubber on the runway\nWheels flush with the fuselage\nThe captain welcomes us on board."}}
