No, a mortal sex.\nWe play this game wi the grunts: what's under the figleaf?\nAnother onky! - A whit? - One o thae buttonholes\nTo go wi the two wee buttons on yr chist.\nNo, it's this! They looked. They were fucking helpless.\nThen here's this wanker wi a flaming sword\nSaying  Get thee hence! - I says what? Get thee sense?\nBut what can y dae? Whack him wi yr rubber truncheon?"}}
