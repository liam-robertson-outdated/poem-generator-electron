{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He never sank a pint but it sank him.\nAt weekends it was piped aboard in rounds.\nHe might as well have piked his head on a railing until Monday.\nWhat starts as sin goes down as sickness, priced in\nTo your fiscal plight. It's all that counts."}}
