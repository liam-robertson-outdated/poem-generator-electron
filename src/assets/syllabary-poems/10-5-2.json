{"poem": {"title": "Periscope (for David Mach)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ethane methane propane butane\nEthyl Methil Fife. So this would be\nA snug in the East Neuk (would that be right?)\nAnd on my left the drab would have to be Ethel,\nEthel the Tart. There's times you surface\nLike a burst mains through a pavement,\nAnd fall apart like an old stockpile of re-treads. Serves you right\nFor getting methylated in the first place. I'm a dab hand\nAt making it look like a master stroke. But what was this:\nSome kind of posh ted footering with a cigarette machine\n(I mean cigarettes? In a pub?)\nTwo bears behind him. A bit too close.\nHe decides he's leaving with or without his fags and squeezes past them.\nOne of them shouts at the back of his head\nAnd your submarine was shite!"}}
