{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Between her toes the grey sand glugs\nAnd gloves her feet to the ankle.\nSoon it gums her step. The tidal\nGrubs emerge, their gubs are miming\nScreams and girns of seagulls. Not\nThe way to go. Back at the beach house\nThe guard dozes, his gun on the table\nA stranded fishing boat at the end of a rope\nBut guns are like that."}}
