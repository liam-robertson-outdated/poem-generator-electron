{"poem": {"title": "Brexit Pursued by a Blair", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Pose as in set down in verse\nThe pros and amateur cons of referenda\nThe cons have it\nFootnote prose is boring\nPoems put the fake in fact\nThe enquiry probes so gently that it tickles\nBlair is back\nKing of the fucking zombies\nOne mustn't call them proles\nOr give them benefit cuts\nTheir pores are clogged - that happens\nThey scratch their back on telegraph poles\nWhen one of them pours a drink, decline\nOr look them in the eye\nIf they have one\nTell them about suffrage\nTalk to them about the polls."}}
