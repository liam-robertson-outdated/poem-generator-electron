{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "An old lady made of driftwood the colour of sand was limbering up.\nWhen I'm young, she said, none of this will have been,\nAnd I'll see written history for what it is: a callow scrawl.\nA sun will rise on the mountain, you and me. We shall exult."}}
