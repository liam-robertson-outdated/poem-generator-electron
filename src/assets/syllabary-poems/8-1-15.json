{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "In your mother's garden, thunder\nDribbles on the chin of a green green lemon\nSplashes on the sill to waste till next time\nLodged in a greener leaf\nOr till, in dim Darwinian days,\nThe fruit extrudes a jaw and drinks\nIn the sweet, astringent\nRepublic of branches\nWhere nothing is stolen and no one is lost\nAnd use of the common tongue does not mean\nCoucher avec les boches. How much\nWould that one cost in Euros?\nPeople now are in line to say\nWe surrender, baby, our neurosis\nTo constitutional click bang psychosis.\nInured to irony they swear allegiance\nYou seek and find a newer way to reach them\nI knew your mother. And you are\nHer daughter"}}
