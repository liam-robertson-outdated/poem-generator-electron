{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Shoosh! I wish I could shoosh till I heard\nNot my blood or my breath or the buzzing in my lugs\nOr, when the wind drops in the bush, my thoughts\nAnd what they think in. Shoosh in the gaslight\nWhat do you hear, when the mantle's sputtering, treadle\nThe wheels of the sea?"}}
