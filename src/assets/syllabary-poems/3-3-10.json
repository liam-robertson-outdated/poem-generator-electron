{"poem": {"title": "A Demagogue", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "This is where it all unhappens\nOne can only seep so far\nReed antennae pronged like lynx's\nEars to the wary wind plod in the pond\nPalled in silt that reeks and ponged\nOf pod and body pawned and unredeemed\nThe frog is prince. It pawed the piper\nPaused and said  'Applaud, my flaccid friends\nfor we are poised to take\nThe rooty river green reflective reaches.\nNever in all my speeches\n(Prod the air and scan the audience)\nNever in all my speeches\nThis is where it all unhappens\nNever in all my speeches\nOne can only seep so far"}}
