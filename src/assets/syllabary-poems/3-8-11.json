{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Rhythm paves the way\nSense is made of mops and pails\nIn water on cement. It pares away\nThen planes and sands and buffs\nWhatever pays, whatever works.\nBeyond the pale's a hunger garden,\nRuddy pears intact. The plains are parched\nA cropper prays and offers fireweed for tinder.\nGods in pairs are glimpsed - if ever - through refractive panes.\nGive praise. Take pains. The warden preys on the redundant.\nHis daughter plays."}}
