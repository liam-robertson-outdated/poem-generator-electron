{"poem": {"title": "Sheath Knife", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "An iron blade in bumper chrome\nA green and red tin pommel\nAnd a genuine leather sheath.\nHow many weeks of The Hotspur\nWould he miss for seven and six?\nAnd which of the Ten Commandments\nWas it wrapped in? Covet and steal.\n\"A leaden sword in a golden sheath\nA godlesse heart in a goodly body.\""}}
