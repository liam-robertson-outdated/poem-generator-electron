{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It snorts and sorts its quills then storks around, the drone,\nPrime time squats feel swat teams put the doors in\nWhen it squawks its radio squawk and stalks\nDissent. Scots wha hae - anyone at all who wonders\nHow they bet your shirt and socks and OWN when they should be IN the stocks\nThey wouldn't exchange two five spots for the credit default swaps\nThey concocted. Who sops up the debt when the jingle stops?\nPainters shall wear kindergarten smocks and poets rhyme,\nSloths gambol in their jungle, quick as treacle slops.\nThere's some go through life like a dose of salts\nSome of us get a rich sauce to savour.\nIn actuarial terms it all slots in."}}
