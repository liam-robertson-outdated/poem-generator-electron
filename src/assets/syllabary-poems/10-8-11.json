{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Emerging from the amniotic daze in certain senses\nShe drains the air or tries again and again\nThen turns to pillaging the milky dales and dreaming of them.\nHer eyes stop shedding light and she negotiates the chequerboard\nWhere he dares to ask and she deigns to reply.\nThat dragonfly alights on a flowering frail like a touch on a chesspiece\nIn joy or concentration. Is it her?"}}
