{"poem": {"title": "The West", "author": "Peter McCarey /Charley Marley", "text": "Soft power'd wax or wane with the\nShellac, vinyl. TV. Drip fed,\nDeep fried. String vest,\nWild West and every wean\nA cowboy then Geronimo.\nYou rode the South Side wagon train\nOr chained your bike to the paling.\nJohn Wayne never had that problem with his horse."}}
