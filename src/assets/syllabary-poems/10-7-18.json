{"poem": {"title": "For Mrs Avery", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A dell, a warm\nDimple in the blanket\nThe cat just stretched and rose from\nNape of the breaker, just that\nNeither here nor there, and Spring\nThe start - again! The start\nAgain! Until it take on something approaching sense\nI wouldn't want to go away\nI wouldn't want it to end at all."}}
