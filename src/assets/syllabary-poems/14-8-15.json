{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "That Octopus vulgaris, precooked,\nPresenting its little hole to me\nIn a chuckable plastic monstrance\nShould mimic a succulent cactus -\nSomething a zombie might\nTuck behind its ear - is not what got to me\nBut the fact that one, on a sinecure\nIn San Diego Zoo, escaped at night\nTo dine on rare crabs in a neighbouring tank\nAnd then snuck back."}}
