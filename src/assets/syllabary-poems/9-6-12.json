{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "So: rhythmic tics and fisticuffs\nWith trysts of mind and matter,\nPlosive tricks and perverse twists\nPassed on by egregious tits and nameless\nTwits, till it trips and falls at length\nIn digital ticks and crosses.\nYou'll tell, I trust, how 'tints\nOf alizarin, rose madder and straw'\nTips the balance for us,\nTilts us from the brink."}}
