{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We got coal for scrap iron from men with horses\nMy dad's work made boilers. The kettle screamed.\nI didn't trust coal: that husky tinkle,\nDirty big jute bags of black false teeth.\nIn Lourdes School, beside the playground,\nWas a coalshed half the size of Ibrox Park.\nIf you didn't drown in the dunes of coal, at the bottom\nYou found yourself on the shore of a sacred stream."}}
