{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A thousand flowers bloomed\nThe jade-toothed chairman boomed\nSome suckers booed and that was that,\nNo bud but bowed to the chairman's\nFlocks that browsed, that ruminate still\nAnd brood on his one-liners, brewed as tinctures.\nHow they boozed! Prisoners, with luck\nWere bound and bruised. At best\nThat was what happened."}}
