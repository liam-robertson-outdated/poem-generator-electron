{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Smith's orphaned. Scliffs along on skateboard skiffs.\nHe tokes his vapid spliffs. He sniffs, and stiffs the neighbours. Later\nSifts his options: the Swiss could sort him out; swifts\nCould tell him about migration, stirps and territories. Meantime\nHe strips the paper in his room, that echoes empty, where\nThe toaster sneezed. He snips his nails, sips tepid, milky tea,\nSlips on his mask and hoodie. Skips a beat. The script's\nNot patently for him: cisgender romcom skits for trouser-swapping\nSquirts, where the camera squints at what's in skirts.\nHikikomori like it with canned laughter. Cysts of untact,\nBiological bubbles in the mix. A circus act, then: SMITH GETS HIS STILTS:\nSits on his hams and splits the seams. Spits on his palms and slits his shoes.\nSplints a couple of bow-sprits from the nearest yacht club (still a tad\nFar fetched), sprints or staggers where it all silts up\nAnd since he doesn't swim, well, he sinks. Down there it stinks.\nFor rescue workers, this stint's the short straw or snorkel.\nAnd what do they find in the brackish boondocks, in the sticks?\nSkinks. Another reptile slinks away. A rusty sphinx that smirks at them.\nWhere are you, Smith? The bunker-fuel slicks; each rescue-service lamp\n(There's six of them) sicks and cuts the aspic gloom in sixths, till one of their\nflippers snicks his cheek. They haul him up. You won't do THAT again?"}}
