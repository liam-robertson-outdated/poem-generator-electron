{"poem": {"title": "Loom", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A red-throated diver, the jut of its jaw.\nI'm weaving the waters in this old tub.\nThe shafts rise on the rowlocks\nAs I pull the oars to my bollocks.\nLand ahoy, like a whiff of smoked egg plant.\nSaint Brendan! With an heirloom like this,\nDo you reckon it's landfall tonight?"}}
