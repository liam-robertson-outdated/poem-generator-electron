{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Headgear like a water butt\nOn a cantilevered alabaster bust\nOr was it a granite bust sunk in a water butt?\nA chest that would bunt and swell\nLike a sail or a puffball, bumped in a box\nTo get chomped and burped; better burked and pickled\nBetter burnt, but not by air-burst ordnance.\nHere, let's get, to a safer neighbourhood, bussed.\nThe brunt was duly bucked. You busked on trams,\nBrunched on garbage, bunched your fists,\nBrushed your teeth, bunked in bunkers, bulked\nIn blinkers. Never blushed at the columnist's\nBlunt words on the migrant question.\nNever bluffed or buffed your act,\nYou'd just blurt it out.\nYou had no finesse at all."}}
