{"poem": {"title": "Pinup", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Twenty-odd years after that twenty-odd year war\nA cormorant surfaces in fog,\nRing round the neck.\nA diamond-eyed, black blonde in negative. The darkroom feels\nPetals? A puckered heart? No-\nSwelling lips. In one eye \u201cenemy combatant\u201d\nAnd in the other Khieu she can\u2019t live up to.\nI\u2019ve done better shoots but I\u2019ve never seen clearer, Madame\nBleary Windyhair\nFresh out of sleep."}}
