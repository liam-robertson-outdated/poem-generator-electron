{"poem": {"title": "A Snake-Eyed Skink", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Swick and swindle, swink and sweat, they're skint\nTo bind your bibles, mister\nSpick and spanic, mister stick it to them smoke em out\nThey stink. Your lady\nSlick enough in silk, contrives to slink\nBut clumps around as if the kitchen sink \u2013 \nYou snick a putt and sink it \u2013 kitchen sink, I say,\nWas chained to her ankle. Is she sick?\nBest hand her that zinc bucket. Goes quite well\nWith her complexion (sic). And check the lip sync\nWhen she makes your statement to the press."}}
