{"poem": {"title": "Bush", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "An old party game-cum-psychological test had me describe\nA wood, a path, a watercourse, crossing it, and so on.\nWhen asked to describe the path I said there is none ...\nEach word is rooted in time and reaches out across its congeners;\nThe only way round one is through another.\nI've found myself climbing up a fallen tree towards its roots,\nBalancing on wattle, hacking through an argument when it wouldn't let me go,\nTill the only thing is this negotiation of dendrites that fork and twine,\nAnd the only other hope'd be some apocalypse - grey boughs\nThat grow as you watch; a thousand years of blossom in a minute - the burning bush."}}
