{"poem": {"title": "For Iris Perrin", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "On a pillow of husky spelt she slept\nOr laid her head. 'Eye hath not seen',\nSaid Simple, 'Nor ear heard': it's not\nA  videoconference. She stretched\nAnd yawned. Stepped through the screen,\nA shiver of smelt in icy stream,\nA local, all set with his net, but\nMissed her. She swept through.\nThey sketched and posted her ID. A Celt\n(they mispronounced it), of what sept and sect (mis-\nSpelt, but stet). They searched; they spent their\nLast red cent on facts to smelt for data. Nada. She\nSaid 'Can't catch me. I'm not a virus\nIn your badgers' sett, the stent and shunt\nSf stressed and twisted politic.\nSexed and rooted things are of the essence.\nWhat you smelt as sweat\nWas scent to me: the zest of it all\nI sensed and love'."}}
