{"poem": {"title": "The Art of Memory", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "'Two gods are at the door for you.'\nI went outside. The agora\nWas Buster Keatoned round me : just\nTwo pillars from that temple\nTo the horseman and the boxer, twins\nThis church of Paul is clinging to like faith\nAre left : old Menico Scarlatti blacking out\nAnd no score to consult\nBut a polis file of stolen goods recovered\nFor Naples has forgotten more\nThan what it is to starve, and what it is,\nLike the song of songbirds in tiny cages,\nThat sage or salvia\nin pots at kitchen windows\nOf hill villages that squat the hanging gardens\nOf villas double-parked\nAlongside byzantine and gothic crypts\nIn seismic streets and avenues\nWhere messengers on vespas\nHave lost their cool, their suave, their messages\nFrom Ladislao d'Angio Durazzo, say, to Belisarius,\nSecretes, that brings to mind both mint and grapefruit."}}
