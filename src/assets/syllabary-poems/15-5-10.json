{"poem": {"title": "Maghreb", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "for Abdelaziz Kacem\n\nOriental island in the West\nA jaw that hinges in Jerusalem\nSavours Arab rhetoric and Gallic\nPoints of honour: intemperate,\nIntemperate dialogue of the deaf.\n\nOld Sarfati has siphoned off the last of the Berber silver\nWith the iodine from salt\nWhere gullies yarned in nothing\nBezoardic memory of water you devine\nIn many a dusty yard."}}
