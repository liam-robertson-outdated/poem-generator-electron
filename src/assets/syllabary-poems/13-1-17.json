{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "See the red berry in the beak of the bird\nAnd the streak of seed and birdshit.\nThe guttered sun passes through the night\nTo reflection on the slate kerbstone in the light.\nAll the nightclouds I hear\nAnd the dreams I forget\nAnd the sunny evenings\nThen the dewfall and the wet\nGrass. I guess\nAt paths through the tumble\nOf the cumulus.\nThere's a tract in the grasses and gravel digests\nAll but the conscious. Only in dreams\nCan the notions pass\nThrough my grounds and grow\nFrom the night, where now\nThey have to go.\nShook off from the sea, there's a city\nRoars and greets in the drains of its sleep.\nAll the breadcrumbs in the black grass,\nBut there's no birds.\nAsleep on the breathing cornices.\nThe starlings are asleep."}}
