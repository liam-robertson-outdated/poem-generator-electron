{"poem": {"title": "from Mandelshtam", "author": "Osip Mandelshtam", "text": "Come and we'll sit in the kitchen, us two,\nWhere the white kerosene smells sweet;\nA sharp knife, and a loaf of bread.\nGo on: you can set the stove to roasting\nOr maybe gather up some twine\nTo tie the case shut. Before dawn\nWe could take a tram down to the station\nWhere they'd not think to look."}}
