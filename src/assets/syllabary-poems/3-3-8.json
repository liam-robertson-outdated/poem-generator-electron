{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If the girl at the checkout\nSo sweet and thirty-five or so\nIs a pawn in a game\nThe defence is patient. Siberian.\nFrozen items imperceptibly\nPong when they're picked up.\nNow the prong of attack :\nA well-heeled customer\nSome doll with matching cell phone\nDeploys her goods and pays\nWith no time for the soft promotional porn\nOr one who meekly checks her out :\nTalking to that\nFrozen king prawn clamped to her chops."}}
