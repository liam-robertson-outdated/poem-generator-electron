{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Beth, a home for me, first consonant,\nLandfall where waves abrade the coins of snow,\nCut larch happed round a stone hearth.\nBreath, yours, from its own ocean\nWhose breadth, whose frightening breadth\nSwells in a corner of your eye.\nBerth - the sailor has, however squalid,\nBut this ship has none."}}
