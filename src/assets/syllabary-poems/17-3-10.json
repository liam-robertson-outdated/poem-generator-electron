{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The arteries are clogged, the cord is taut.\nWhat once in clover coiled, now clawed its way\nThrough cogged procedure and slyly claused protocol.\n\nIn the ringing quad he'd conned\nVocabulary, coined the odd mistake\nAnd called it art. The clod.\n\nMany are called\nBut few are frozen cod,\nAnd they don't crow.\n\nWhat caused him to smart was the hushed\nChord of a lover's voice."}}
