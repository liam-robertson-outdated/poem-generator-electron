{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The tyke was a wee Jack Russell\nBarrel-chested and bow-legged.\nMy dad had it put down when my mother died.\nThe trike was a big maroon thing\n- pavements only, no two-wheelers -\nWith a big kind of beige breadbasket\nAt the back, for toys and messages.\nI mind it going completely out of control down from Angus Oval,\nMe having to take a header through a hedge."}}
