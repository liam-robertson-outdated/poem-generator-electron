{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The god of the horde\nHomed in on Palestine\nThat honed its stubborn ploughshares;\nIt worked and hoed its peasants,\nA lichenous arrangement not worth\nScraping off the rock, which is why St Andrew\nWith his hoard of Dead Sea skaith\nHosed the fish guts off his bib\nAnd hoist the lot: sail, saltire and purse-seine net,\nTo hold course for Fife, slow punctured\nBy relic-hunters after nine-inch nails."}}
