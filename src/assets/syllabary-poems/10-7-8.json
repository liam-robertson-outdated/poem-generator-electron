{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We built a den where the prefabs had collapsed\nAsbestos board and willow, a nomad idiom\nCalqued on the blackbird's nest.\nAt night it lay empty. The war was dead.\nGaudy wrappers snagged in the hawthorn.\nThe refugees talked just like us."}}
