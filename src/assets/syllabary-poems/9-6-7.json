{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "There was a wee house\nOn a big plot\nPlanned and planted with figs and cherries,\nOranges, lemons, grapes and apricots.\nThe mountain over the roof\nPeeks at the sea.\nFirst house it was this side of the track,\nNow most of the town is here.\nIn the clean tilth of the orchard\nAnother house has erupted\nIn broken flags and tackle,\nRusty shade and tinder left from winter.\nOne olive tree, new planted, that could live as long as this,\nBut even Horace, a local man,\nWon't outrun the race of the hoe,\nHere's to them. There's a beer in the vaccine freezer,\nA chopping block in front of this chair\nLooks fit to hold a glass.\nI haven't done a fair day's work in my puff;\nNot starting now."}}
