{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Who would be goy?\nUnwrapped and discarded\nBuilding whole empires to show they don't care\nThat they're not the one.\nHard to ignore, you'd have thought,\nThe pale watergaw (not a real rainbow),\nFlag on what's left of the customs house\nUp on the cliff, snatch at the wind."}}
