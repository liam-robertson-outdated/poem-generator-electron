{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You are so\nSlow\nThat though my toes are sprouting\nTotty roots in cellars of my sleep\nI still have time to clip them\n(only one needs disinfected) and outrun you.\nI could sew a lifer's worth of gunny sacks\nAs you fumble for the complement to that verb you uttered earlier,\nStow your every breath in subtle verses\nAnd, as you turn towards me and away,\nWatch the Arctic ice and snow disperse and recongeal."}}
