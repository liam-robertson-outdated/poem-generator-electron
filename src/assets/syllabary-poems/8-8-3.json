{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "To coil and skewer a tress\nThey hoist their elbows\nThat lift the shirt across their ribs\nWhilst at their nape\nThere's always little spiricles escape\nAnd however fine and finely canted are\nThe muscles of the neck - in males as well -\nThe vertebrae, like an ancient motorway,\nSnake into a cave at the base of the skull."}}
