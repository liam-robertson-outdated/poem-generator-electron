{"poem": {"title": "Rasse", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Racks and ranks of creels\nContaining rats or civet cats of some kind.\n\nRafts of such repositories,\nSampan towns of blocks of flats up there,\n\nWhere raffs of rain slant the streets\nAnd rhythm rants on windows.\n\nThose syllabaries tethered in the cross-talk\nRide at anchor. Metal rasps\n\nAs the ramps of ro-ro ferries\nShut. The little creatures rax and yawn."}}
