{"poem": {"title": "Gled", "author": "Aleksandr Blok", "text": "Circling, ring on even ring\nAbove the drowsy huts it hovers\nAnd watches the deserted green.\nA cottage hearth; a harrowed mother\nSays  - eat your bread, son, take the breast,\nGrow big, be good, take up your cross.\nThe years go by, the wars go on,\nRebellions flare, and burn the burghs.\nYou never change, my ancient land,\nIn all your beauty, in all your sorrow.\nHow long should the mother mourn?\nHow long will the black kite turn?"}}
