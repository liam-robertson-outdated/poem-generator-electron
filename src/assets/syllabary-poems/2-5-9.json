{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The nib flew backwards, fast, a bat\nIts wings as daggers flung at the blast of dark\nIt banked and barrelled, backed up, backed up\nI bashed this out on brassed-off keys\nThat barked and snapped at every serif\nSome brat, some bract of a garbage lily\nBranched across my window listened in\nThe binary system blacked and blanked it\nSorry officer this won't happen again."}}
