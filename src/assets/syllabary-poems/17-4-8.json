{"poem": {"title": "Golden Apples", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"This'll nip\", said Doctor Curran.\nHe was a currant without the stalk,\nA sort of wine gum.\nThe colonels sat in Corinth drinking retsina till Sunday\nWhen a dab of purple iodine bit like a javelin.\nThe doctor had got my mum and dad an ottoman (spell that \"autumn\")\nWhere blankets and candlewicks slept from the show of presents till the frost.\n\nPagan and protestant clung to their beliefs in kirn and kirk\nWhile I was minting myth like chocolate pennies:\nUp from the pier in Rothesay, I came across one of the Paisley Hugheses\nAnd told him I'd just sailed across the Atalantic\nO'Keane (attaboy! Atalanta!)."}}
