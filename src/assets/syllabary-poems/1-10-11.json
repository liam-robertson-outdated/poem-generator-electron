{"poem": {"title": "Olive (for MC)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Where age is beauty, avert the eyes\nOr, like Modigliani's chrismic women,\nDo without them. Vincent tried to paint you,\nOvid didn't name you in the Metamorphoses;\nFor Ulysses the sailor man\nTinned spinach was the better part of valour.\n\nVrubel' caught your cousin's\nLilac aisles of blossom in the isles of wood\nThen thought if he could stare until the ides\nHis eyes would turn to emeralds. Aye\nAye, my dear, not every man can praise you,\nBut I have made a capo for an old guitar from olive wood\nAnd this will echo in your upper reaches\nFor a day."}}
