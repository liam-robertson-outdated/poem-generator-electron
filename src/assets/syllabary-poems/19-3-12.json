{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Wops - who needs them? Not policy wonks.\nCops chase them round like two noodles in woks.\nNail one of those perps and he walks,\nHe walks. Their lawyers are wasps,\nCapable bastards to straighten the warps\nAnd botox the warts, if that's what you do to them.\nWho needs the grief? Who wants the - say,\nWhat's a woman like you\nDo \nIn a clam bar like this?"}}
