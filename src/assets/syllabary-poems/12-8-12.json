{"poem": {"title": "Quarry", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A wheeze in the jakes: light a tuppeny banger,\nRoll it under the door. Forgettable japes,\nThe bits and patches, chapes and senses\nTime chafes and uses, cuts to the quick - \nHowever so the deer cannot outdistance\nInnards heaped on its hide for dogs to tear\nWhenever it is one cuts to the chase."}}
