{"poem": {"title": "Leviathan", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "in memory of Giulio Regeni\nPluck a quill, dip in and scrawl\nYour bloody judgment:\nHumanity as biomass\nEquivalent to krill in the cold ocean\nWhose convection\nRenders them in a vertical commute\nTo the vertebrate.\nIn the belly of the beast, the fact remains\nThat every day you torment,\nMaim and kill a child of God\nBrings that judgment closer."}}
