{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "My dad was the size and shape\nOf Hammett's Continental Op. He costed blueprints,\nBut didn't have his father's\nSubcutaneous way with heavy engineering,\nThe investigator's tact,\nThe what to squeeze and when to smack\nThe fractious into tolerance.\nThe artefacts my dad and me have jiggered in our time\nBecause his father didn't live to say: this way.\nWhat Pinkerton's men will twist my ingenuity to fit\nTheir faces, their facts and cases."}}
