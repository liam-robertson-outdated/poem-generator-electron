{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Enthroned, with the plunger and sponge\nAnd the showerproof headgear, she waits\nAnd is waited on, under some strain\nIn the lift, caught between floors\nWhat a job, and the plumbing at full stretch,\nFor Britain to take back control\nFor Europe to plunge."}}
