{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Where poets weigh their wordy husks\nAnd fletchers huss their witty barbs\nAn occupying army huffs\nAnd humps its body armor.\n\nFrom prison hulks that lie offshore\nA sergeant hunts and fishes.\nHis little hunks of jailbait cry\nThat hurts! Don't do that!\nIn sordid huts he does it all the same.\nThe same old song, the same rendition."}}
