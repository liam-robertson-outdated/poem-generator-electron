{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Scads of goods and scams to get them. Chat up slags at pottery slams.\nStrads are fiddles and psalms are rants. Stags are trophy ruminants. Spam's\nWhere I.T. sinks in its sands. It saddens and snags your songs and goods\nThat might have gathered up all the strands of the delta.\nYour span's abridged. Selves are salves on nothing,\nSags in canvas straining spars and sheets.\nWhat scans? Pretty scarves on the livid and the living scabs and scars.\nWith his eyes tight shut he stands and starves the light of any sense. The sun stabs at him, and the other stars."}}
