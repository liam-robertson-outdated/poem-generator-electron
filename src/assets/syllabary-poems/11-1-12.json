{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Two no-use sleuths embarked at Leith\nIn sharkskin suits their pumpkin soup's cried over.\nIn the roads, some sloppy sloops were\nHappy slapping spilt wave scoops of milky firth.\nAnyway, they're just snoops. One stoops to needle\nStooks of facts and check for coopered stow-aways.\n- I say they're spooks: vice-presidential sycophants\non a thousand scoots a day expenses.\n- but they drink like boy scouts: wee gruntles\nslurping hoffs and stouts in the cocktail bar. Nae style;\nand then those gusts of brussels sprout. Soused, they are,\nand we're still in port. Come on, spruce up."}}
