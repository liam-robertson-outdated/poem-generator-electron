{"poem": {"title": "Angkor Sweat", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What's in a nem but greens and prawns and carrots ?\nWhat's in this shirt of cotton, sweat sodden ? Not\nThat bosom swelling from the collar bones\nOf the dancer by the moat at Angkor Wat\nBut something rancid. It is\nMyself. It is my self."}}
