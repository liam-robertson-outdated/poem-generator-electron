{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Or how, far out in the Kalahari\nYou found, on the keel of a rock\nPainted in the Bushman idiom\nAnimals long gone from there:\nIce.\nIce where ice is law and metal brittle\nColours blench in the reserve of all\nAffection; the reverse, but the prerequisite,\nNearer than anything else on earth\nTo nought."}}
