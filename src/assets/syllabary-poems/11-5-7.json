{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "This might have been my favourite port for waiting out monsoons\nIn lamplight, behind bead curtains\nBut holiness cut a strath through local life:\nWomen took cover and men to the pulpit.\nThe singer who mocked their pat exegesis\nOf mudslid muezzins and rubbled kirks -\nWell you know what happened to him.\nFive centuries on, some archive explorer\nWill crack a wry smile."}}
