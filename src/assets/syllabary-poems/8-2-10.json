{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Is the increasing coldness and complexity of what is\nA good? We thrive so close to absolute zero.\nAll that ancient heat to etch our pattern on a jar\nFor one reader or none (is there a difference?)\nAn old clinker on the river nosed ahead: we'd won\nOr lost. And that harmonic node on the standing wave along our hull\nSubsided."}}
