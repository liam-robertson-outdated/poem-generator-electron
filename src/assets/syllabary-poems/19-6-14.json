{"poem": {"title": "Snapshot", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If she'd asked him to dance\nHe couldn't have been more\nUngainly. Freeze and say cheese!\nStick em up and relax!\nThen there's her, in cahoots with the camera\nMake a wish.\n\nThe wings on this big boeing\nTwang in the winch of inconvenient\nWeather. The usual voltage runs\nA torch of shadows\nBy which I pick my way."}}
