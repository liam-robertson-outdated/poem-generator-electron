{"poem": {"title": "Guzzle", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If thunder's one of the seven deadly sins\nThen so is bragging to me about your means\nAnd sharing nothing. Show me another drunk\nThat binges only on other people's wines.\nNo don't: leave your wag on the wagon.\nConfronted with a ticket machine, in shock\nYou pat your pockets till someone else stumps up.\nI leave you there. For what\nDepresses the dinner out of me\nIs that praise you lavish:\nIt must be really cheap."}}
