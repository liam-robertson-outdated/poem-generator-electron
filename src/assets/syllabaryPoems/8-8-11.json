{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He was a knave, a jack tar in the Swiss\nNavelry, where names and nouns part company\n(Renown has made a name for itself, aye aye, but the nays\nWill have it). The nightmare neighs and sleepers sweat\nResin. No nails in the wood, where capsized keels\nAre set on ruddy piers to roof the nave."}}
