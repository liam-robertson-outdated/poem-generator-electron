{"poem": {"title": "Stevensonia", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sixteen men on a dead man's jet is odd, but understandable.\nBetter would be sixteen men and a dead man's jest \"har har, there was no treasure\".\nBut sixteen men on the cabin trunk or thorax of a dead gent -\nThat's the roof of a bus in Bangalore, or\nCycling in tight circles with the wobbling\nSmile of a wedge of acrobats."}}
