{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Screen the heart\nFrom the gang's excesses:\nSpleen, adrenalin and sex.\nScreen the heart\nIts security clearance. Don't forget\nIt has its reasons.\nScreen the heart\nDon't make a scene\nOr exhibition of your innards,\nBut there's things to be believed\nThey have to be, my love, seen."}}
