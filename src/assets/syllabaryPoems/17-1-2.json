{"poem": {"title": "X cubed", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Where parallels meet, the cube becomes\nA sphere in placid orbit.\nThe die is an imperative that never comes to rest\nWhere Y is latitude, alliteration, start of a sound\nAnd X is longitude, rhyme, a syllable's end,\nLet Z be the changing light from equinox to equinox,\nVocalic play on assonance of place\nSo that when I'm asked But daddy, what's the matter?\nI'll can say\nThat who and you and I will meet again or maybe not,\nNot \"Nothing much\", the which, while strictly accurate,\nIsn't true."}}
