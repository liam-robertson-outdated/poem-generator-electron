{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "'The tweed's the thing'\nSays Polonius. His baby\n(He picks a three wood)\nTeethes on his lapel.\nOot owre the rough he tees off\nInto the trees\nThat promptly march on Dunsinane\nAcross the fairway. Cut!\nTo teas and ices for shiftless teens.\nAlone they tweeze expression\nTease out sophistication for the rout,\nFor dual teams and peer review\nThen it's rain that teems Leyland Atlantean windows\nIn pinball surface tension, butting through\nThe tears of things."}}
