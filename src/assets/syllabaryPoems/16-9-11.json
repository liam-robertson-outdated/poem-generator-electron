{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She gears up.\nYou grease the limbs.\nDull gleams\nAnd buckled greaves on lunar coin\nSome miss but no one grieves.\nFolk eat their greens and mind their own\nPoultry gleans what it can.\nThe glebes and kirks are quiet.\nGrebes on the lochan. Geans\nSquander blossom,\nGlieds of inspiration\nSpent."}}
