{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Whereas it's better to enter the Kingdom of Heaven\nmissing the offending limbs than not at all,\nthere's some truncations make this life impossible.\nThat's as it should be.\n\nYou wouldn't have wanted to live without your legs.\nUnder the knife, out on the trolley,\n\"laughing and joking with the nurses\"\nas they say,\n\ntill the post-op shock had cornered you\nand drowned you like a kitten. Up!\non your tip-toes, up! and He'll lift\nHis Cathie over the Pearly Gates."}}
