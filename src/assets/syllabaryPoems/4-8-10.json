{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A maid and her blue-maned mount?\nWould that emblematize the un-mailed text?\nThis is not the rose and the olive,\nMaimed and scorched to carry more;\nIt's that thought not made to couple with noise\nOn disputed borders\nIsn't thought at all."}}
