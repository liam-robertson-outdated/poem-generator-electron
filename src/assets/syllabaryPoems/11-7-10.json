{"poem": {"title": "Zed", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She said send for some bennies\nAnd sped. What she'd spend on them spelled\nD for zaster. Her nose bled. She stemmed it\nWith the sleeve of my snazzy suede vest, which perhaps\nSmelled of something that caught her distraction. She tracked it\nLike a husky and sled. A whole team of them\nSwerved off the track. Swelled to a pack\nAs dinner was served. Could I stay here instead?"}}
