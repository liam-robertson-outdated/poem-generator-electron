{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "All of a sud\nThe dove-grey tempera\nSmudged on her eyelid palette\nLandward she surged\nNow listen, Spud:\nAll of a sud\nThe J-cloth squirmed under knuckles that stubbed it\nScrubbed and sponged till letters\nSmudged and surd, till readers slurred and lost it.\nThe waters sunned themselves. An oarsman, pacific\nSwordsman, sculled across them. That's\nAs fair as it gets. \t\tI snubbed him.\nDidn't deign. \tHe said, Listen, Spud:\nYour Botticelli rerun's a load of pish.\nNow there's a shame: you'd got quite poetic\nFor a critic. \tCut it; listen:\nHow many a stud of young men\nSlugged it out, strummed under\nBalconies, who now scratch on the porch -  \nNot men, but badly stubbed-out cigarettes. I'm one.\nThe itch remains, is all.\n\t\t\t\tBut it's not that.\nThe notion that some power slummed it\nFor our benefit - Sophia by the pyramids, in the scud,\nFor Solovyov - may be reduced to\nA tremor in the vision of a solipsist. But\nWhat stunned and troubled and provoked him is not mortal.\nSomeone at the sales tries and discards a dozen things\nThen smiles at the assistant: I'll have this one."}}
