{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "As I was driving down to the video\nShop, with my daughters in the back,\nA woman was walking up the street in a black\nDress, cut just above the knee. She was\nHoney-brown and beautiful, black\nHair to the neck, black shoes and a\nBeige raincoat that didn't really match:\nThe outfit was underneath. She looked\nAhead, but her expression, while\nRapt, was far from humourless,\nAs though she knew and accepted that\nHer radiance, especially\nWhen she was dressed in black, was such\nThat cars would suddenly\nDrive as if through honey."}}
