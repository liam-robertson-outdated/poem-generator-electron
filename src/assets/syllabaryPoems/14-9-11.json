{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Poems never written down\npebbles in the ocean's throat\nLagavulin's tawny shine\nclaret's memories of oak\nthat never took to shingle beach\nor saw its seasoned rings would rhyme\nin rosined ships, in reels of mine;\nwe're fiddles sunken in their song\nfrom peg to bridge, across the briny\nocean-o to Capricorn\nfrom Uist, garrisoned with sheep\nand two-and-twenty (count them) years\nasleep in postcards. Out of the blue\na curving swell will hit the shore\nfrom blistered winds in ecstasy\nthat none survived, or no one knew."}}
