{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The agency pries and prides itself on that\nIt's to prise the snapsprung velvet\nOf what's taken for your heart\nOpen and apart. Random quantifers\nSifted for primes. Aerial grey\nIn a stand of stone pine. Surprise:\nFour-and-twenty haircuts analyzing pies.\nIt's not that secret priors are more keen on using\nPliers for extraction than the opposite faction,\nThat they stoke pyres in other parts\nWith piles of abstract flesh\nThe stuff their leader plies us with\nThe liberty they prize."}}
