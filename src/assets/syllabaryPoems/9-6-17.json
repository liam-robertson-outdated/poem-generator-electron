{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A sheep tick engorged in my forearm,\nIts wings like an artichoke leaves sticking up?\nbut here's the trick: it was a cyclamen.\nNow root it up gently; there's\nBarely a graze,\nThere's hardly a tic of discomfort,\nAnd carry it, rinky tink tink, to the house.\nIs that borage or cress on my bicep?"}}
