{"poem": {"title": "East of the Urals", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Quell too much and the system seizes;\nToo much slack and it falls apart.\nMost of this fuel-oiled electrification\nGoes straight between the birch trees, Moscow time.\nThere's yet a pendular sway, some pulse and burden,\nAn iron mother; me in this berth;\nAnd all the lullabies she cannot sing."}}
