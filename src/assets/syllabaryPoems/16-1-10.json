{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Glued to the box\nThough you grued at the headlines:\nGroomed for abuse, as in curried,\nOr surgically gowned,\nGrooved with disposable sharps,\nLeft on the ground, in a swing park,\nOut of her gourd. You think, Hobbes:\nWhatever the object\nOf a man's appetite or desire,\nIs what he, for his part, calls\nGood."}}
