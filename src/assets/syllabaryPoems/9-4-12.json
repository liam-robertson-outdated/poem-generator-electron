{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Tough stuff, time, that won't\nBend back. It tucks you in like milk:\nYou're stuck. When the truck struck\nA poor scrunt was rearranged\nAs though the dying - only them and then -\nBrailled, like baby mammoths' trunks,\nEternity, that turfs them out. Alone for now,\nWe cry big turpentine tears. The ram tups,\nNo more in love than it bleats in tune;\nWouldn't dream of Mary's little tough\nTwo tufts and you're gruff. A couple of\nPantomime Turks in fez, truss and skirt. This circus,\nThe rusty trickster turns up trumps."}}
