{"poem": {"title": "Braille for Beginners", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Tina's out on bail. Her daddy's rich\nTherefore her children shall be rich. Capisc'?\nNow whence the lolly... beauty, vigour, youth?\nNo, yes, no. Connections, guanxi.\nBrute force for brains. You should bet a bale of shirts\nOn this particular horse if you're sure she'd not\nCharge on through the hedge when she got to the bend."}}
