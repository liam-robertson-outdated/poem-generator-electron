{"poem": {"title": "Cops in the Coppice", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The champagne quarks are popping in the particle collider\nWhere crystal quartz streams in buckets and quarts.\nCrofts and crofters drift in the outer rings. Quoits of cigar smoke,\nClots in the lung. A corpse in the making clocks out.\nMissing the crocks of gold some women work up\nHe conks his head on the first outcrops of sense.\n\nThat wouldn't be law enforcement officers hiding in the spinney?\nWhat's the protuberant coxcomb, then?\nThe muffled coughs in the wainscot's what?\nIf that's the crew that jumped ship, well the coxwain's good and cross\nHaving to heft that hull, having to humph his own shell up the road."}}
