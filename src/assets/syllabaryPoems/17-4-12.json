{"poem": {"title": "Cuss", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You will buy on the cusp\nAnd sell in your cups;\nIn silly wee deals\nBurn your fingers to clumps.\n\nWith the back hand it cuffs you\nWith the forehand it cuts,\nFor if life's a bear, you're not\nIts cub: you're a klutz.\n\nAnd may all the cunts round you\nBe just like yoursel, except mair:\nCults and kirks of you. One clucks\nIn the pulpit: \"prepare for the rapture!\"\n\nOch aye. When the door clunks\nThat's your fingers in it;\nbut mind when you curse,\nIt'll boomerang back. And this\nIs the crux of it: go and unravel,\nYou cardigan."}}
