{"poem": {"title": "In the Bothy", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "One of the pine boards for moulding concrete\nIs sawn across, for two supports.\nAnother piece of shuttering, on the saw bench\nIs made to the width of the cabin : table top.\nFour three-inch nails whacked in.\nThe tool, the skill, what comes to hand.\nThe mason's apron\nThe trowel towel\nWait a bit:\nCould Uncle Starfish be\nA magic fluter,\nA chip off the old block ?"}}
