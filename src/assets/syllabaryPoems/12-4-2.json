{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Barbel and chub lines must be very strong\nFor a chub is the worst fish that swims.\nA soft fish, and tastes\nLike brown paper salted.\nThe soft fish swims worst, and soft the worst fish swims\nTill it's locked on the hook. In the deep frier it thrashes."}}
