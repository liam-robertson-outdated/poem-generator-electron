{"poem": {"title": "Howard", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"Norfolk sprung thee, Lambeth holds thee dead\nClere of the County of Cleremont, though hight.\"\nTwo trochaic pairs, a hard jolt, then charging dactyls.\nDead names; another heist, another title.\n\"Hiked up to Scotland, flattened them at Flodden;\nWhat thanks do I get? He lops the boy's heid aff\".\nThe king's man - not your own - that anger\nBrought you to the block. Your prosody\nWon past it. High office, much hyped,\nIs nothing without the depth\n(Wide though you were)\nTo make it work. To stop the king."}}
