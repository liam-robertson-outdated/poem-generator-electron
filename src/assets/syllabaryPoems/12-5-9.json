{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The chart was japed and splattered\nAs was I, with salt and laterite.\nTo check the chassis I'd jacked it up.\nChapped at the door of a place I chanced on\nBack from the road. Some whispered chant,\nMaybe twenty voices. What I'd wanted was\nA chat with a mechanic.\nNo signal. The door opens."}}
