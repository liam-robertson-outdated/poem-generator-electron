{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Grips the arms and grits his teeth.\nThe poet with the double sonnet done in glyphs on his skull\n(Roussel, of course) is cheating. Guilt's a bitch.\nBut liquid glints of sunlight, the fine return on gilts,\nGifts of living tendered and withdrawn,\nAre too much for him. Drill for the glisks of gold. Trepan.\nA shutter glimpse of her ineffable beauty\nIn camera is uttered."}}
