{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "On a judo mat in splats of sweat\nHe's marked out the crimectomy\nHis sparring partner's matched with fifties facts\nAnd in they march, un-\nmarked by the bull mart: wolves\nInasmuch as wolves and bikers march\n(Put whatever gloss you like on matt).\none flag comes down, another\nsidles up the mast. Who was\nthat masked man?\nSanction busters maxed out\nOn crude. Manoeuvres.\nMassed on frontiers. Tell me\nMonths from now for this\nThe bloodlands don't get pulped and mashed again."}}
