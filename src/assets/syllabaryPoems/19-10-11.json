{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sense along the wires. Sounds\nAcross them. Broken dolls\nWives of the wind in cuckold bungalows\nThe backroad numbers and un-\nWinds in shale laid down for Georgic\nWines of an age where the line no longer\nWhines its whats and whys. Till then\nShe whiles in whist, her wiles\nUnderemployed. Out in the wilds.\nNo word to the wise."}}
