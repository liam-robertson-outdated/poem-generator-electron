{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Such are the rooms I haunt, the rows\nI've caused in empty houses. Rounds\nOf drunken talk unwind. It's hard\nTo rouse a man from that. And yet\nShe did, with ruse and reason. Well,\nSome ruins you abandon. Certain\nRunes are left unsaid. The rules I broke?\nIt was them or me. You might say\nHe rues the day."}}
