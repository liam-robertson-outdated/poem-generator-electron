{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I gowfed with the board at Carnoustie\nGoosed a waitress at the 19th hole\nHaw haw. We groused at Pittenthing\nWith the Chiseler of that Ilk, who grouched\nAbout gormless Pictish beaters\nGrouped on the sphagnum\nUnder a golf umbrella. Grout:\nUrinal drip by drip deposited\nIn between his joints,\nGout and spite that came with the territory."}}
