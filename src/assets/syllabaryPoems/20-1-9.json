{"poem": {"title": "Lout Music", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The body of the lute is the weight of an echo.\nA quiver of notes is loosed off\nSoft as syntax looped around a stop\nIn the pulse. A hundred feet below, if you looked,\nYou'd see the rioters bearing loot from Indian corner shops."}}
