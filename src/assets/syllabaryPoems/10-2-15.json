{"poem": {"title": "Goldilocks (for Beverley)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "At the end of the road - a door you don't want to open.\nPivot.\nA trapdoor; the road runs up a backdrop.\nTiptoe to the prompter's box, slip in:\nYou're there, above the pit.\nThe folio says gehenna, annihilation.\nYou tilt it and your head to see what's scribbled in the margin.\nAnother roll. Your road negotiates a ledge;\nThat door's a shuttered window in a wooden hut with a stone hearth.\nClamber in and sleep till you wake in the feather bed."}}
