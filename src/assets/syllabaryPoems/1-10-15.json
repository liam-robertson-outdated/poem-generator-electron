{"poem": {"title": "Goodnight, Irene", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Irene, I dreamt of you again last night.\nNo need to tell you. You told me\nUnless we stayed together I would not see you again.\nYour tongue is salty, pacific. We grappled\nIn the alcoves on the street but never quite\nSand in my saliva when I woke, sand in my pockets.\nShells in the bathroom marked  \"Made in Formosa,\nIreland\" the wintering of anger\nLazybeds of semtex please\nDo not disturb the sleep of Roman\nReason with the gods Irene, Irene.\nIris, rainbow, messenger of the Greek\nGods, I see you gold and brown and black.\nWhy? Have I lost the farther colours?\nOr are you the message now? Tell her,\nTell Irene, tell her anything, from me."}}
