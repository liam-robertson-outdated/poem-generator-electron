{"poem": {"title": "'Tishe vody, nizhe travy' (Blok)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Took the Scottish highers\nLike a deer fence, its\nInvigilated hush. The herd\nHides in its numbers. Can't see\nThe wood for marts and hinds,\nFor venison and methane.\nIt swarms on ruin,\nHives and shingles of rugous bark,\nVerbal contract hires\nFor trivial hits and highs."}}
