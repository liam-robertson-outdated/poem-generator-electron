{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A smudge of room-temperature\nSludge on the surface is life\nOr its premiss, cold in the lens.\nA fresh bed of scutch would be habitat. Such\nAre the signs. Signs of infection\nA great surge of fever. Quick\nSponge her down, bathe her forehead and wrists."}}
