{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Tis true: he tims the ashes\nTrims the hedge and trills a popsong\nAs he tills the border into twills\nOf loam. Twirls the hoe, ho-ho!\nTo cowe the twigs of the\nWanton lilac. The twins\nHave got their orders: to the crema-\nTorium; two tins of cinders, one each."}}
