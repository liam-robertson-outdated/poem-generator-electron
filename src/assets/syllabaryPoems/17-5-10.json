{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "My word - a cad at the dispatch box\nA junk bond cadged for a cancelled goolie-chit\nOff a broker canned for indiscretion who\nWhen it clanged on him, thought (well he WOULD do)\nWhy me? My word, no sooner calved off of white noise\nThan it's carved in nice distinctions,\nOne card, in a deck, in a drawer.\nIt gets coined and crammed\nUnder the tongue, clammed up\nUntil, clad in its owner,\nWho'll have calmed down and out,\nIt means whatever you want."}}
