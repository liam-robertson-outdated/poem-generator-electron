{"poem": {"title": "Putem zerna", "author": "Vladislav Khodasevich", "text": "The sower walks across the furrowed field\nWhere father and grandfather both have toiled.\nThe grain of wheat is golden in his hand,\nBut it must fall into the black, black ground.\nAnd it shall, where the blind worm makes its road,\nAt the allotted hour, die and grow.\nAnd my soul too will go the way of the grain:\nDown in the dark to die, and live again.\nAnd you, my country, and you, its folk,\nWill die and live again. The year is dark\nAnd the only wisdom, our only sign:\nThe living all must go the way of the grain."}}
