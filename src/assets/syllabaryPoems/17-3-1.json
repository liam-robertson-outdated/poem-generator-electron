{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "There's nothing shy nor coy\nAnd nothing sweet to cloy\nBut there's more to the hoodie than\nCaw and claw to the craw.\nThere's a resonant, woody cluck;\nI'm told there's some can talk.\nNothing else that size'll\nSee off kites and cats."}}
