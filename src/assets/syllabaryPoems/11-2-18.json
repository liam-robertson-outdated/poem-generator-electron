{"poem": {"title": "On Dover Sole", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You need a soul to go to hell;\nTo resurrect - a body.\nScroll down. Do the zombie hip-hop.\nYou can use the one you stole,\nYour sole concern. It was rented kit.\nTake a stroll, take a walk on the wet sand.\nIt goes dull as a dead fish."}}
