{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What quails in the cradle dark of ancient quairs\nThe cairns of print and vellum\nLurks in celadon craze\nIn the clean claes hoist on anorexic canes\nIn crypts and caves where the pilgrim\nCraves a sign and cranes his neck to see\nWho cares."}}
