{"poem": {"title": "Oh I Do Like To Be", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He blagged his way in, bagged another\nAnd bragged again. All told\nThat barbed and liquid muscle blabbed too much\nWe barred him. He barged in\nPress-badged the doorman banged it in his face\nFor he was banned. No more would the brass band play\nHis theme, that brand too hot to handle.\nA has-been bard, tiddly om pom pom\nBad news."}}
