{"poem": {"title": "Dorics", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We've got falls to write about; they don't:\nThey thought up fauns: viagra with the hoofs and horns of bambi.\nWhoever faas is deid, no drunk.\nTheir flaws are divinely crafted.\nIt's slaves the guidwife flogs, not wedding china.\nFrogs are frogs: they don't get pawned for princes.\nPassion fogs the reason, not the glasses.\nThe last act hits the hero, however he fobs it off,\nWhereas, here, a lawyer foils the fates like chicken\nIf you pay so. Their forms are platonic; ours are electronic."}}
