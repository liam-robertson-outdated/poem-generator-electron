{"poem": {"title": "Grace", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "After a week we drove down from the snows\nand woke to find primroses in the park behind the house\nwhere, after about ten minutes, she got fed up playing football.\nI'm bored, she said, and smiled. Can I climb the cherry tree?\nI got her bike from its place in the neighbour's garage\nand this time I'd mislaid the pump adaptor:\nshe must have got to ride it all of a dozen times\nsince we bought her it three years ago. Three years.\nMetabolism takes her at ten metres per second squared\naway from me."}}
