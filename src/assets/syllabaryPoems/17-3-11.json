{"poem": {"title": "Oxfd", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It's not true. The cogs are agley.\nChain slips and crawls on the sprocketset cobs.\nPlatform clogs and clods in their cords\nClich\u00e9s in three chords the quad squad puts up with\nAnd corns, and decimal coins. Coigns of culture.\nLib and Lab lost, it's the Cons taking over\nNow. Coils and cloys of weird smoke.\nThree wee craws sat upon a waa\nOut of the way of the cors and buses\nThe cols up in Brecon, the claws of the raven\nA relative clause to compare and contrast. Afraid to take calls\nWith wistaria coming at you down the phone line.\nThe cockerel caws\nWith no end to reason there's nary a cause."}}
