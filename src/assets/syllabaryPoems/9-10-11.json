{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The tribes and their tributes,\nTheir taxes and tithes,\nGo on blunt silver tines and gold teeth,\nSwinish finery:\nSilk twines and tassels and trinkets and ties.\n\nSo the sack-cloth kicked in\nAs the tides can reverse on the mud flats at night;\nCocklers look for old tyres to cling to.\nOne tries a last call to his wife. Kitchen tiles\nTransfer his signal to the rumble of tread\nOn the sixth urban ring road. It tires her out,\nPicking info from acres of echo, the tempers and times."}}
