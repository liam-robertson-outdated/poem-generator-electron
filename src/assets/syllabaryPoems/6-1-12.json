{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The fruits of the mulberry\nFlutes of baroque\nThe flukes of desire\nThat Ahab is trying to harpoon.\nIt's like shooting back at Cupid\nStupid\n\nA clonic assembly of Fausts\nIn the founts of banality frowsts\nAnd it flouts the convention\nOf thought and intent. Figures\nFlouse. And they frounce and they flounce."}}
