{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Mist on the pass between\nPaps of whin. The downward path's\nBeen dealt a hand of different pasts\nIn guns and ghosts. Parade-ground soldiers\nPrance, impassive, muffle pants and grunts.\nYour doctor palps and listens. Perhaps,\nShe says, it's nothing. Pats your wrist,\nPacks her little bag. Intricate pacts unravel\nPax in terra. Killing pranks and pratfalls.\nHenry parks the cash and planks the bullion.\nSome loser plants the body parts that don't add up."}}
