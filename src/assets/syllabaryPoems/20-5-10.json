{"poem": {"title": "Arcadia", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Bucolic yes idyllic no\nThey all lambed at once\nHoned on winter wind, the pack\nWas onto them like 'land ahoy!'\nWith fire, a drystane fold and a squad\nOf berserk dogs in place, the shepherd lad.\nBelow, a cellar's stocked, a boiler lagged\nFor a lard and worsted corporation."}}
