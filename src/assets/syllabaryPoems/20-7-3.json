{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Luther flung an ink pot at the devil;\nA boatload of Jesuits hit Canton.\nAlways throwing things around.\nThe Large Electron-Positron Collider at Geneva\nRejigged for smashing hadrons. Do you want\nTo model the Big Bang or repeat it?\nWell, he smiled, the closer we get the better.\nJust so we turned our big bang guns on pyrotechnic China\nWhich met the foreign devils with ink and a wolf's-hair blade."}}
