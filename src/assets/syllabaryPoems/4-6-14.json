{"poem": {"title": "Karma Gadelica", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The Minch a glittering bridge to the ocean\nA mishmash of beaches, machair and cliff\nNo midge is a nuisance\nNo pluke is a rash\nNo man is an island\nSome of us, but,\nAre nuisances and rash\nWhich accounts for sebacious eruptions\nAnd burning clouds of midges\nOn Rhum."}}
