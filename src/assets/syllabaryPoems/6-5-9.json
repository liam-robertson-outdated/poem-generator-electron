{"poem": {"title": "Noises Off", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Don't say fart: she's fragrant,\nWrapped in silk and franked in gold\nAddressed to the languid audience\nBut flashed into that revolving door too fast\nSo now she's faffed in a paper jam\nA fact that won't be faxed\nParts of her wedged flat within\nThe brush-flapped, oak-flanked entry. It ain't over\nTill the fat lady sings."}}
