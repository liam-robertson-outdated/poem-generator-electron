{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The pack fanned out\nIts dealer blind\nTo the dark\nWe blunder in\nThick livid rain.\nWhat prank, you wonder\nBrought down the wrath?\nA fitba where it says\nKeep off the grass\nThat's down to moss\nLike dental plaque on raw\nConcrete inside the boat pond\nIn a play park where\nWee pirates walked the rhododendron plank."}}
