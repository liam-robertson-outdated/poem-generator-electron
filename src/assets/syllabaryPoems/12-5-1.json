{"poem": {"title": "Theism and Biscuits", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Before they took to brewing drouthy wine, the Israelites\nGot tannin chewing saddle girths, and spat. There's days I wish\nThey'd traded jah for cha and druk pu-erh and read their tea leaves:\nA man will come with scandalous good news. Don't cross him; give him\nTea and some of your granny's biscuits, hard as hockey pucks, to dook in it."}}
