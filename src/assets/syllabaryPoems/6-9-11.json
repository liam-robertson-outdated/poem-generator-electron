{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A Phrygian frieze where stone-cold\nRage and fears freeze in a fridge\nOn a plinth, your art plugged in\nOn line, the battle order\nFrees up. It feels\nLike death, though how would I know?\nVerbal ticks and fleas make what they can of it.\nThe colonel feeds his mount and flees on foot.\nFees and commissions mount up.\nIt all feeds back in a loop\nInto the big picture."}}
