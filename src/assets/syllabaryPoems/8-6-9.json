{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A nit is not a gnat it won't go\nSplat like a balsa biplane\nWhen hit. It\nIs a not yet louse, a\nPawn to the pediculous\nNeedle of the knit. Awry, sir knicht.\nEasy nicked with a fine-tooth comb\nNipped between the fingernails\nAnd cracked."}}
