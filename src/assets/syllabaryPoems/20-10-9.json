{"poem": {"title": "for Ken and Angela Ofori-Atta", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If light were affliction\nIf the dark were cash\nIf one could be weighed against the other and traded\nIf bales of light were delivered by boat from across the loch and parcelled out\nOnce a week, say; we would hear the engine\nAnd though we liked and enjoyed the darkness\nWe would still be queuing up, clutching coin."}}
