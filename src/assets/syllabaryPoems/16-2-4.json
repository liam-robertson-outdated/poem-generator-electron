{"poem": {"title": "Conjugate", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A stairhead glimmer through the cold.\nWe stretch and roll, and the cover's off,\nWhich makes my flesh and goose-flesh rise.\n'To his Mistress, Going to Bed' would sing\nlike old wine in my younger skin,\nwhere time is drawing maps.\nThe brain is playing favourite tunes\nThat skimmer and gloam with the sheen of your skin.\nThe nouns decline like Roman gods.\nHold on and let them all\nGo. We're down to verbs and prepositions\nThat steer us till we take the swell."}}
