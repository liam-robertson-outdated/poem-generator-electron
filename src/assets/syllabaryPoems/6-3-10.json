{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If the creature's flawed, the fault is with the maker.\nBut when a cratur cracks, who gets the blame? I've fawned on none\nBut the fraud faith in an absent faither\nInstilled by two fond parents who were there\nTill the dice of my vertebrae straightened like a frond\nIn that cold wind.\nStruggle with silk buttons on a frogged tunic,\nAnd laws that flogged and goaded me, but protected her.\nThese kodak memories will have fobbed me off until I'm old,\nSat there drinking tea. The windscreen fogged a rainy firth\nTill all the well and ill-formed movements of the heart\nReveal themselves to one no longer able to take them in: foiled again."}}
