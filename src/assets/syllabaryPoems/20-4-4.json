{"poem": {"title": "Gloom", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If I can deal with the angry, maybe the sad will let me be.\nIf I stay under the water, maybe the smoke will let me breathe.\nA snorkel lum? I don't think so.\n\nThat anger's got to go -\nThe angry man, the angry manner;\nEspecially in the right.\n\nSo cultivate the sanguine and phlegmatic\nPower and knowledge commensurate\nA double tulip drunk on rain."}}
