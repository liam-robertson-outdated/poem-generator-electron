{"poem": {"title": "Psalm", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If you're not there, I'm all alone\nIf you don't care, it doesn't count :\nThe scam in the system.\nI made this up myself, at least. I didn't lift it\nFrom some piece of smarm to Ra.\nIf I'm the slam in slammer, not\nThe son in prison, tell me. I'll stop.\nI swam in the sea today. It wasn't bad\nAt all. I was fairly nervous, like now.\nNothing like the ugly, panic cancer..\nDeath doesn't worry me, cruelty does. You got that ?\nAmen."}}
