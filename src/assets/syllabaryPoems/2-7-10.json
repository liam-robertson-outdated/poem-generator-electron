{"poem": {"title": "Not by Bread Alone", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "On the river bed\nOn the river bend\nOn shingle such as caddis worms compile\nWhere frail signals bred\nThough some of them don't so much breed as\nBlend and subdivide\nWhat bled in the rush, in the rushes\nBelled and shunned for its native sly\nWould have begged, the fallen, would have begged."}}
