{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Business class is brilliant. It's like being in a pram.\nToddle up to the front of the queue, you get tucked in.\nA lady checks your buckle's fastened. Just like your mum\nShe gives you sweeties, she gives you toys.\nIf you frown she knows your name, she says what's wrong?\nI never travelled first. Must be even better:\nThe total prenatal experience, warm\nSnug to yourself.\nGet what you want before you even think."}}
