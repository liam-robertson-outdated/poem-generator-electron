{"poem": {"title": "After the Rout", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Let's not lament the makars or forgotten songs, but thank\nThe readers in whom Henryson's survived obliteration.\nI'm not falling  off the map, quite the reverse:\nIt's coming away like gauze, for this\nIs the promised earth. Lank grasses\nAssuage the lack on which the world's vanity\nDraws its flickering charm. The drab skylark\nFinal plummet silent."}}
