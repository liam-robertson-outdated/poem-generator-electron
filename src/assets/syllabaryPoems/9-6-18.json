{"poem": {"title": "Vengeance is Mine", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Tirl the lock. Now pummel the door.\nThere's a lull in the killing. This is war.\nEmpty the till. Stop the push of the drawer\nWith your pubis. Pocket the notes.\nHouse-to-house searches grundle and twirl,\nCrash through the living-room wall.\nTill the old town with an Abrams plow;\nScatter contempt and it grows.\nHere are the dudes in their cavalry twill:\nThe supply lines have finally caught up.\nTill later, we barter.\nBombs are in dollars, buildings in blood.\nWarble and trill, little bird. In the garden\nLater, bury your voice."}}
