{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Once upon a bus processing\nFaces, butts and busts, irregular\nBursts of lurch and go as it\nBlurts its sample at a stop\nCommutable births, come on, get off,\nBut that was us, Beijing. The thing\nCavorts and bumps along\nThe ruts and bluffs of tar. Its driver\nBurps and buffs his occiput.\nThis young woman, standing next to me,\nPuts her head on my shoulder, falls asleep.\nOn into town, her skull, my collarbone,\nNothing else. Till one alights\nAnd we're back to the sound and sense Time blunts and hones,\nA gamelan duo that busks so slow\nYou'd think it a chess match\nWhere they take to their charpoi bunks between two moves\nOr have a smoke, till, whack! the xylophone bucks:\nWhat proves to be the last note bulks and fades."}}
