{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He's at it.\nOne big act.\nMuffled noises aft would be\nThe future catching up on him.\nHe asked for it.\nThey axed him.\nArt is love and skill, it doesn't\nLook for applause -\nThough its vector might.\nThere it's: arked and vaulted,\nThe spectrum arched above it,\nCommodified, fat-arsed,\nAmped up, maybe\nOr wooden apsed and cloistered,\nQuiet, apt.\nTill ant and termite redeploy it\nCrumb by crumb\nAnd my old aunt gets morning mass\nIn an empty church\nAuld kirk, an altar\nNative."}}
