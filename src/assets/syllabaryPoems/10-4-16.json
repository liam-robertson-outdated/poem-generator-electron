{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Man the drugs! The superstructure's\nGoing down! Women and children first. The simple\nSamples never know what hit them,\nHere a septum, there a lung or artery.\nBut the mongers dug it:\nDrug a barter system, it reverses\nSo the bankable commodity is want\nThey sell in wraps."}}
