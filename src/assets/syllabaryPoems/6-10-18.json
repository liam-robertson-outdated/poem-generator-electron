{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The ranks were closed, they went to press\nBut trod that brittle phial of doubt.\nIn fifty years they haven't closed\nThe case; alibis are all off pat.\nI mind festoons of cuttlefish cloud\nAbove the lamps, a sopping blotter,\nMe weighing out the word ASSASS-\nINATED: proof that though, like it,\nI didn't show on Super Eight\nOr Polaroid on the scene that day\nI really wasn't there in case\nThat crackpot in the warehouse missed."}}
