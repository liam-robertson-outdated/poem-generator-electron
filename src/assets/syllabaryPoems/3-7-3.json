{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "This is a pep talk men. I tell you\nYou're going to go in there\nAnd you're going to go in there prep\nPrep. Prep. Would someone help me?\nThat was a perp walk. Man you just can't\nBundle a president out of the courtroom\nHeel of your hand on the crown of his head\nLike he couldn't duck into a car by himself.\nYou're going to go in there: I wish\nThat I was going in there with you guys.\nOnly fooling."}}
