{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "As sparks run through the stubble\nAnd a burning cordon inches up the hill this summer night\nHe's drunk on dead wine\nThe bad guy with his rented dinner.\nLive music at the bar-B-Q\nLive bait at the bar\nLive ammo, one presumes, in the piece\nThe grinning barman's groping for.\nIn walks Simone Weil and orders a shandy."}}
