{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The zit, a sebaceous eruption,\nWould sit and spit cherry pits oot owre the rail.\nHe sipped his rich red to the silt\nThen slit something. Whoops\nSpilt it and slipped on it,\nSplit a seam, put one leg out as a stilt,\nZipped up, slicked his hair back.\nWhere was he? The sitcom,\nA skit he would build on it,\nSkipped to the pratfall,\nSkimped on the build-up, scrimped\nAnd saved nothing. The script\nWas stripped to some squirt in his shirt-tails,\nA skirt. Him with a squint, her\nThat boo-hooed and sniffed.\nThen they sprint round the sofa. Such fun.\nJust 'cause you're skint, just because\nYou got stiffed, I mean if\nYou make something, work till it's done.\nDon't stint."}}
