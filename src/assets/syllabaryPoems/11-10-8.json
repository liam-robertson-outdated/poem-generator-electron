{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "For all sine lang(uage), a wave\nBye bye for seas between us\nBaith hae roared our tonsils hoarse.\nA hoarse? Whit's it daen at the Rangers end?\nFor Bertie Auld a spline, my dear:\nReset that gnathous grin.\nYou point: a bovril and a bacon roll. No, gies a pie.\nA spy? There, elbow-crawling up the park,\nNight vision trained on Dobbin's jaw\nHingin open like a sock drawer. No, that's Bertie.\nSpecial forces. One of them? The swine.\nSine out that gless and pour yoursel\nWan fifty faithoms deep. And here is a sign for you:\nThe spine on the rose. The last defender\nAnd the open goal."}}
