{"poem": {"title": "Oisin", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "To a Renfrew auntie, I was Peter-og,\nOg, young, as in \"Tir-nan-Og\", the Land of Youth;\nMy dad knew that much Irish. In the War,\nOne Major Bellringer had asked his mother\nIf her son could serve in Eire; she said No, her son would not\nGo back to the land of his ancestors a spy.\n\nOisin stayed in Tir-nan-Og so long, when he returned\nHe found his race replaced by Hom. Sap. sap..\nHome? he smiled as he withered, Now where would that be? But our man\nThomas of Ercildoune went west for just on seven years,\nEmerging numinous and\nRattling rich as Mungo Park."}}
