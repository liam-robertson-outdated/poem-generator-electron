{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Jock sucks on a soor ploom, sups up his pint and\nSulks: he's one of those sumps for bitter vibes that\nskulks in his boneyard bailiwick till somebody stumps him.\nHowzat! The skunks, says he, as into the crease he slumps.\nOn sus the Law slurps up the usual quorum. One of them smiles or rather\nSmirks at the word that spurts from the Man unbidden.\nShe sloughs her kit. How many times today? Don't call us sluts!\nWe're worksuckers, fuck-swappers, insultants. Don't be scared!\nWho scuffs our paintwork anyway and scrapes our little scuts if it isn't you\nWhose scurf's in the pleats of our skirts?\nWho stuffs ourselves - or tries - and struts away adjusting buttons?\nNot us. But who, if anyone, snuffs it when you go in the strunts,\nWith scruffs and scrunts and pimps to do your bidding?\nThat's your law: one surfs, another suffers."}}
