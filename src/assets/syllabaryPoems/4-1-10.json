{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What syntax grappled and grammar moved\nIn Burns the numbers mowed like reek\nThat mouthed and bloomed in kinky neon,\nMooed across the Firth of Clyde in a paddle-boat steam shriek.\nWas that a buzzard mewed?\nA burly barman mused and shone his shots.\nThe stoker mooned and built his mound of dowts.\nNo in the mood. No way to let off steam."}}
