{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A lilt of swell to lift it clear\nCaulked with lint and liniment\nIf you licked a stamp and stuck it to the hull\nWould they deliver?\nWhat system linked and storm uncoupled\nTook more than a boat to buckle as it limped\nWater lipped the deck and lisped in spray.\nLight poured out the sky.\nWith a moderate list to port, by night it lit\nThe feeble flare of the wake."}}
