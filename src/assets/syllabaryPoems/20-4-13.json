{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The trouble is I plug my nose to sneeze\n(I'm learning manners) and\nMy lung (the one that's left) comes out\nMy lug (the right one); time\nPerhaps for a cochlear implant in\nThe spare, so when I take the lunge\nI mean the plunge in church, and leave\nMy trusty crutch to cling, I know\nWhen down the aisle to lurch and when to say\nI do."}}
