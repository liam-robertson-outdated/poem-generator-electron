{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The cool curve of fingernails\nOn my back. No:\nCold days in summer\nAlone in the pool\nRain on the reach of my back\nThe green trees and concrete shower block.\nTwo metres down\nThe swerve of an arm\nFrom a dull lens of strength\nRemember limb by limb\nAnd curve by muscle\nHow to swim"}}
