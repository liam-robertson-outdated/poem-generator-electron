{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Device: it looked like Hans Holbein the Younger,\nStark as science; date - coming on 500 years ago.\nThe central shield was empty; angels' faces\nVied with hidden forces for control.\nEmblems that draped the horrid vacuum\n(Some cover-up on innocence made to pay)\nWere probably not symbolic, but mnemonic:\nMagic memory theatre; forgotten play."}}
