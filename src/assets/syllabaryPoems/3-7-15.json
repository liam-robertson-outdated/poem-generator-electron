{"poem": {"title": "Per fonte Branda non darei la vista (Inferno XXX)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "There are three big, whiskered carp in Fonte Branda\nThat swim into the focus of Dante's net. Not\nThe handycam, adrift like a retina, not\nKnowledge, that drinks a stream to catch a trout,\nBut the laurel wind, the dawn wind daily\nReinvent the whorl."}}
