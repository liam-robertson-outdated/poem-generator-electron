{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A zoo\n's a zoom\nysee, mzee,\nThe varmints nest in the arc of the lens\nSo close up you can smell 'em\nTheir vertebrae and vellum.\nWhen's\nFeeding time? Who's she?\nA sow in a skiff\nA pig in a scow\nWho'll wallow in offal\nAnd stow like a sofa.\nThe slough in the trough'll\nBe scuttling bilge\nAnd is that where she's\nRooting for truffle?\nThe keepers strew\nWhat butchers slew\nA huntress could spew the dead meat,\nClip a screw, but the skew of the bars\nStops her swipe. And you can't\nSue for war."}}
