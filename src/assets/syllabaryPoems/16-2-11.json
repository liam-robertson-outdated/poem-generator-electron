{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Not muffled groans again!\nCan't all get golds.\nDelaney goads his donkey bristles\nBrowses rocks in olive groves\nAnd gores the brick-red dirt.\nIt goes nowhere. And gets there.\nRound it, a bubble around breath,\nA market grows, a theatre, it the aria\n(No Callas). How the audience,\nShelves on shelves, glows about its bristle wick.\nThe goals of their economy shift and swell,\nThe globes of this megalopolis."}}
