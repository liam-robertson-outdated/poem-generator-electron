{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Boredom he says. He says it drills\nA wee hole in yr heid. No the third eye.\nAye. No. Oh he does, dizzy? Aye\nAnd it dings down to bone and it says this is it\n- Which it isny, he says, ontologickly speaking.\nDings doon the phone: disney like big words.\nWanna thae bright sunny daze;\nA primrose digs itsel oot.\nA bee is, like, helicoptered in,\nPinballs aroun, dizny get it; back to base.\nDid you order this day? Says my boss. Ay a did;\nDim's the word, I said. Pay for it later."}}
