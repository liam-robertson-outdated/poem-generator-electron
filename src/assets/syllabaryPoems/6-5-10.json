{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "O Sole Mio plus zen equals fado\nNostalgia borne as vanity so grand\nA package tourist might not miss it.\nFad for bread and olives, bacalao\nIn Jesuits contending for Japan.\nThe Fang had just moved in when they\nFlagged Angola from the coast, the Portingales\nFarmed as a last resort, wrote out\nPessoa, sang Lucilia do Carmo."}}
