{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "At next to worst it's as when, after a liquid lunch\nProlonged in hope the rainstorm might relent,\nAnd having forgotton how to reduce the volume on your headphones\nWhile trying to sing a completely different song to your companion,\nYou happen into a swarm of angry bees that's been blown off course."}}
