McCarey", "text": "\"The Princess dressed in white, the orphan,\nThe child who died and lay in the white coffin\"\nThe Vampire dressed in black, the flirt,\nWith Hammer Horror silk red lining,\nFearful cramp in the vamp of her\nRiding boot. 'Cool casket, dude, pale throat\nBut say - do you come here, orphan?'"}}
