{"poem": {"title": "Artou / Off the Map", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "In the map shop, the music playing\nWas John Coltrane so far away\nSo far away, some rag-top Rolls\nOf a raindance raga, Indian English plosives\nIn the tabla's Vedic commentary.\n\nThe map I took to be Tamil Nadu\nExplained itself as Hindu Kush\n(As fingerprinted by the Swiss).\nAs I looked down to touch the names\nIn the folds of Kashmir beaten in lines\n\nBy nimble hooves and bangled heels,\nSrinagar joined Schiehallion\n(the first hill caught in contours), Lochnagar,\nAnd every trait I'd flatten out, beyond my span\nOf days for sensing the ribcage rise, a country's cadences."}}
