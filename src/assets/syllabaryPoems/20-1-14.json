{"poem": {"title": "Trrism", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A gnarly tree and every flower\nFull as a louche. A dust arcade\nWith billiard hall, two travel agents,\nA plastic surgeon, some antique shops.\nA wild smell of pork and antiperspirant.\n\"A big sword, then? Abu Sayyaf\nSold these to buy their M-16s!\"\nA Song grenade, sweet celadon.\nFlip-flop in the heat as though\nYour spine were a stem, your self\nAn insect bathing in the calyx."}}
