{"poem": {"title": "gauze", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The gauze of language pulls away from empty settlements\nAs gods on wooden horses cram the trunk road heading north\nLike too many leaf galls on a sprig of oak\nThat Gauls and Philistines consider sawing off, although\n- Perhaps because - they're sitting on it, gobsmacked.\nGingerly, one flicks the gongs in the music room, which whisper,\nAnd grogs in the hearth."}}
