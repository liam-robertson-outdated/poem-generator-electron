{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Whales hum. Something - not the gannet - \nWails. The moon wanes, good.\nThe weans are asleep, wames tight knotted\nOn their grub. Wagonloads of wares\nReduced she wears next to the skin, not safe.\nWades in. The waves disperse her\nGravity. She weighs not less but any-\nways that's her on board."}}
