{"poem": {"title": "In the Gods", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What bodes it\nThat he who\nBows the fiddle, blows the flute and thumps\nThe boles of beech with one of those\nFossil hominid femurs fir for hunting\nBoars in winklepicker brogues should\nSave his breath for cooling bowls of\nBrose? He bores us.\nNo one follows these,\nThe breadcrumb bourns of his bewilderment."}}
