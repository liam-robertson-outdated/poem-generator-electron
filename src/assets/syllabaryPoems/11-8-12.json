{"poem": {"title": "Exchange Value", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "When straights in suits, their shaded gaze,\nSteaks instead of ears, close cranial scrapes,\nBone up on the chicanes and straits\nA renegade lone ranger strafes,\nGerrymandered stripmall scapes,\nThe final frontier,\nWhat slakes a thrust, what even for a minute\nSates the principal is a target.\nFor both our sakes, let's hope\nThe safe's a secret. Hopes and snakes.\nThe stakes, as Henry the homicide bomber quips,\nAre low. They're what we've got.\nHe skates of course, his slate's as clean as karma.\nUndelete? And what about our fingerprints?\nWhat if one of those losers states her case?\nWe are on the wrong side and we won\nThe usufruct of space. Now now, no need to look so fierce\nThough it might be time to make ourselves scarce."}}
