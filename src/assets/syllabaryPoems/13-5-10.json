{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The pitch was on the seabed\nI was in the net that you had\nSlipped in a quiver of shad\nAnd nothing snagged but an intramuscular\nShard of the cold north wind\nJolted my wife from sleep to utter\nDark in a house like a foreign tongue\nAnd that dominican cold north wind\nPut what was out there to the test.\nOld oak trees are shreiking\nI am not, nor have I ever been."}}
