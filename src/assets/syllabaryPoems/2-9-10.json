{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She breathed on glass\nWiped every bead and broke it,\nBreezed in and beamed at the gawping guests.\nThe bride was a good breed:\nBrood-bearing hips. The groom\nBespoke breeding, all nurture, ill\nNature. Clip that beard and it'll bleed. No,\nReally: she sat down to the bleared\nAnd dusty screen to watch alone."}}
