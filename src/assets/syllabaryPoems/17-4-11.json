{"poem": {"title": "Social Distancing", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Bone runnels, grips and kirns,\nCurls of butter, curds and honey, crumbs\nOn the breadboard. Milky tea.\nAll those hills to climb!\nThe asymptotic curves to flatten!\nCulls are a drag: the cringing curs,\nSeal pups and bloody clubs,\nWhen just a slice of lemon curbs the scurvy.\nCousin, there comes a time\n'Faut bien mourir de quelque chose'\n(We have to die of something). But\nLet's not all rush at once."}}
