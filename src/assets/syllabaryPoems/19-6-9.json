{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I wished, but not for her,\nThough when I woke on the topmost bunk\nShe was still asleep below, and dreamt of musk.\nIn the 3rd-class wagon others wept and sang.\nA star winked out\nThe meniscus winced\nAs a pail, winched up,\nUnstuck the surface. Whit?\nThe cream o' the well?\nNot as in whipped or whisked.\nI wished I knew and, sudden, did\nToo much: set out like a hand o whist\nThe braird and wilt of the brilliant\nIneffectual wit."}}
