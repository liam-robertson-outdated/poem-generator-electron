{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Maize'd be noise to plant in rows\nAnd stack in tins on shelves\nIf not for May's happy mayhem.\nThen again, that maze is a one-track mind.\nIf your heart goes out to the beast\nThe maids and little males it took are gone once more.\nBut it maims the bereft, that killing,\nThe nightmares' wet manes in your face,\nUnanswerable mails, earth shock from the mains;\nBroken not like horses, but as celadon which,\nPieced together again, is here for keeps."}}
