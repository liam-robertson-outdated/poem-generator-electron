{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "In crumpledom I stoke\nMy syncopated self with breakfast. It\nHad kept on missing in the night\nThe pedals of its pushbike. Run on\nSmoke it chugged on sand. Refloat\nWith soak soak water. What a frail\nSpoke in the wheel, my one-stroke engine."}}
