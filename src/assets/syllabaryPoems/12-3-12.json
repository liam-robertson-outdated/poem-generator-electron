{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "When the joints are out of season\nSenior management has its choice of\nHigh retreats and beach resorts, a geographical\nBox of chocs for business jaunts and business\nMenus, slurps and chomps. Chocks away!\nOrganic scotch and soda by the pool\nShe jots her bullets, jaups a splash,\nChops what has to be cut, chalks up\nA victory for what? Her suits,\nBlack as choughs, watch for tips.\nHere's one: the joss in joss stick\nWas the Portuguese for god.\n'Joss pidgin' was religion.\n'Joss pidgin politics?':\na game for pious pricks."}}
