{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Here's the kite that never flew,\nThe crossed bamboo and cloth too\nHeavy. Here's the woolworth's rod\nThat never quite, o alright, never\nHooked a trout. And here's\nThe bell that never rang\nat 4 a.m. For here's the crew\nThat never clyped. Not that verse\nPoses any threat."}}
