{"poem": {"title": "A Song of Sixpence", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The fanfare pealed and tinkered, a euphonious\nTraffic jam, the constable-conductor looking pleased\n(I'd plead on his behalf diminished\nResponsibility). The cabinet queued and peed in the common\nOr garden gardy-loo. The chancellor preened, unshaken\nTill he peered at the looking-glass\nAnd got quite peeved on account of its reluctance.\nSome oik, perhaps, had peeled its silver back\nTo sell for sixpence. (The king,\nBy all accounts, was sixpence short.)"}}
