{"poem": {"title": "Navvy Lope", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What navigator shovels with a rudder?\nFrowned McCarey, who ploughed a wake before the hull\nTo lock it in the landscape.\nA furrow deep enough to sow with totty boats and churches,\nManhattaning in March then going to spore.\n\nA railway cutting rubbles with a shudder.\nWho dat lope\nAcross a skyline once upon a West?\nThat interloper!\nSitting in a barber chair still chewing his cheroot.\nThe cartel delegates its rest\nTo trigger and escapement.\nLily's planning her elopement."}}
