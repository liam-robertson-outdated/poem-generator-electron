{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "'A dry yin wi a twist for him, a dirty wan for me.' Another tryst\nAnother glass to see him through. 'Here\u2019s tae us!' Feckless twit\nAnd useless tit tricked out in Pictish duds. Here's tae us. Still\nTheir nicotine tint, the spirit-level tilt to their cups was clear\nTo the barman, whose cockroach whiskers twitched;\nThat couple ticked the boxes: place a call.\nThey tripped out. Never settled. Tipped like toffs."}}
