{"poem": {"title": "Rimbaud", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Routine pugs the lip of watering holes that star the desert\nSomething purrs and backtracks on a pond that purls in nothing\nPurple plums, violet bloom, mist on a glass, must in the bottle\nA regular plugs a pub's last barrel with his liver\nPuns and quarterquibbles aren't what the poem's for\nBut your immense, meticulous dislocation of the senses\nIs death, that didn't need your help."}}
