{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Talking heads in ruffs. The codpiece,\nLycra rumps and sackbutt solos.\n\nRhyme that still could jilt rational ruts\nThough its rhetoric rusts in drizzle.\n\nRough's the word as out her pram\nThe queen shies chewed-up rusks and toys.\n\nRucks of her police with orders\nCleave the groundling runts, stage left,\n\nTo cut the nose off Mucky-Muck\nAnd Mrs Mucky-Muck as well. Why not?"}}
