{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Breakfast is the best meal\nSunday breakfast after mass\nThe full cholesterol deal. The extended\nFamily, at least three of them\nStricken with angina\n(Never saw the inside of a pub).\nMy personal best is three: at the hotel,\nIn flight and then home. Don't clear away\nThe breadboard and the jampots; never know,\nMy paints and palette, as Renoir might have said\nIf you don't need to paint like you need\nYour breakfast, then don't."}}
