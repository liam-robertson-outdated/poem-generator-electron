{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Nauseous, abrupt, it crests and crashes, but\nReturns - the weight and the swell and the slide.\nChitinous rights and a chemical trail of obligations\nToil in clefts of a broccoli jungle, global lung\nWhere quests are doomed by complex ToR.\nMeek commensal: what's your freedom for?\nHow famous is cress? How successful?\nWhat vetches blazon, or change hands for, gold?\nI set the little letters out as clefs on staves\nSo cutting keys to every pause and quaver."}}
