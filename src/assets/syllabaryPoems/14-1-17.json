{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A rook will perch in the fog the time it takes to write a poem.\nAt least one knows the Russian for cottage cheese\nAnd croaks tvorog at the dairy maid in Stariy Pitergof.\nOn a chequerboard kitchen floor it won't play chess, though,\nNor can it get its head round its reflection in a glass. Just so\nDid Thales struggle with eclipses of the sun."}}
