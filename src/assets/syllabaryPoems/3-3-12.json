{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "One of the points pops, and out plops\nSomething sebaceous. Random\nPocks, or so they seem,\nTill one of the profs, on a surreptitious\nSnapshot plots the complukations\nWhose maker would pumice or ponce them away.\nPots of cold cream on throbbing prompts.\nThe pains and the pomps,\nThe ineffable longing."}}
