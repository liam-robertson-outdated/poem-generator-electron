{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Shuck off the rucksack\nAnd sleep on a hop sack\nAbaft where the fuselage\nDwindles. The foliage\nSnarls one float.\nIn a steep, climbing turn\nIt's away, singer sewing\nThe web of the map\nWhere a small, civil servant\nSays I do not like this work"}}
