{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We're a buzz on the circuit\nRecycling\nScrap and iron ores and haemoglobin.\nIndite your careful odes\nTo get the meter read in hertz and ohms\nWhich is not what you meant. But then\nWho owes and who owns what we don't know.\nShip oars and drift.\nYou might take the rushing crackle for applause."}}
