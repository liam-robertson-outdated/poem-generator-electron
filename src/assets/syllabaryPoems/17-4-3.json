{"poem": {"title": "Self-Portrait in a Hotel Mirror", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The brows of a raptor\nBut not the beak\nBlack pupils and nostrils\nGrey and amber in the eyes and teeth and hair\n(A clump in either ear)\nBaby skin crumpled,\nFolded, drawn around the lids\nVertical pleats on a clean jaw, seven\nFurrows on the forehead\nThick neck, a good slant to the shoulders.\nThat teacup is grey and empty now\nWhile I'm on the cusp\nIn the curl of the morning"}}
