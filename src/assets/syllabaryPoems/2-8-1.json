{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The one that drove me to it\nSues me for it. Madame, madamages. At bay\nA heid-ache like the headset on the Monarch of the Glen. I bray\nThe body arthritic and grind my grains of silence\nFor the voice of Otis Redding\nAt the dock of the bay."}}
