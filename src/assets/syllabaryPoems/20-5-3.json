{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The lamp with its truncated cone of a shade\nAn updated crinoline lit from within,\nThe oval of light from it folded at ninety degrees\nWhere ceiling met wall;\nA prussian-blue cat on her lap\nPlaned off of the dark in the orchard,\nApples no longer kept safe by the drystane\nAnd no longer plucked by the likes of myself\nGoing home from the library.\nShe'd be nearing the end\nOf her novel, due about now\nFor return or renewal."}}
