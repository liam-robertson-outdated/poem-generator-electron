{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The rhododendron on the green\nIts heads and limbs so crimson heavy\nHeaves itself out the ground,\nA magician's scarf from a top-hat.\nExpect a scarlet cypress by the house,\nA pillar of fire on this slope to the water\nVisible to the naked eye from the alpine ridge beyond.\nWhat's that? Says one to the tother and hooks his\nLine around a rock. That is the home of the\nUnknown Scottish poet (howks a lump out the s\u00e9rac).\nAnd what's he like?  - hoots, how would I know?"}}
