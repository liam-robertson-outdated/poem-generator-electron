{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A cup on the garden table brimming over\nScowl of concentration. Thinking back\nSchool was about the dunce cap and the strap, a wooden stool\nBut crack a twig and who knows what you'll startle from the gorse\nWhat spool from brittle branch"}}
