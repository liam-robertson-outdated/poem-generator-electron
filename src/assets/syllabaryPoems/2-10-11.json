{"poem": {"title": "Lost in Translation", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He begs her indulgence, she buys him a drink.\nRoutine goodbyes and then suddenly - nothing\nEver again. It's back to the biles of the self,\nThe bribes and discourse\nOf society: brides and their beaux,\nJustice that binds,\nMoney that blinds us to this.\nWhat bides? \"Memories\", she'd said."}}
