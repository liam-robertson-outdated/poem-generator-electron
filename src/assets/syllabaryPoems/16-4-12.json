{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Friendly fire engulfs the grunts on the ground. They show their guts.\nThe god of the armies gulps and gluts on wads of fingersnacks.\nSaddle girths are straining on the generalissimo's\nCeremonial rhino. It's a great day\nFor freedom gusts of anger can't deny."}}
