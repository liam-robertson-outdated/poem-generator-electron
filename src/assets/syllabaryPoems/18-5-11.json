{"poem": {"title": "Has", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A rail of hams on hooks, commuters\nRealise the harm's done:\nThe haves and have-nots don't do things by halves.\nYou just hangs on. Who hands it over? Naebdy.\nGoods are hags that ride you into the grun. And freedom is\nAne noble thing."}}
