{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If the eyes were the lamps of the soul and the soul were something\nFished out your nose, a squid, perhaps, doing its daily\nForty laps of the mind till a fingernail lance it,\nEmunction flicked in pellet form at larks in the caller air,\nSight would be re-routed to the brain, I think, while the cabling lasts;\nThe soul would work remotely, anything lax,\nAny lapse in faith and morals signalled with sarcastic laughs,\nFor we know, lass, since Aquinas, that the soul, like seraphim,\nLacks all sense of fun. The good news is\nThe eyes are the lamps of the body."}}
