{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The body is simple and good\nIt is always the infant, always itself -\nThough sometimes two rivers will find the one bed.\n\nThe mind is nothing more than\nNothing wrapped in a rainbow flag.\nAnd nothing was wrong:\nNot these lights, these limbs.\n\nThe crimson sign that you impressed on me\nWas fever on the wind.\nThe riverboat beats upstream, the shoals divide.\n\nThis is my body, and to understand\nThe just conclusion that you drew\nIt hurt like a toothache, till I found\nThat it had made me the simplest sign of all."}}
