{"poem": {"title": "Analog Consumption", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We're lined up on the Dunlopillo foam\nMattress quaffing 'Ola Foam\nThe fourteen-pound enamelled iron shell\nOf the projector splinters memory:\nAir and water and light beaten stiff\nInstead of featherdown, milk and thinking back.\nDad bought it. The motor caught\nAnd celluloid bubbled up bacillus\nOn a sputum smear."}}
