{"poem": {"title": "A Squat in the Chinese Cemetery, in Manila", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She doesn't mind. I know\nBecause you move into somebody's\nCrypt - if they don't like it, they\nMove into your head and you don't like it:\nYou're back to sleep in the street, for that way\nWhen you sleep you sleep. But then\nHow d'you get clean clothes for going to work?\nSure I work. And cook and clean up, watch TV.\nI think she likes it. Not TV. She likes us here\nSince she's still getting used to being dead.\nAnd that takes time. Some take a long time.\nBut the government's in a hurry\nWith their new dead paying money:\nThey'd take her out for trash. So it's\nMove over Mrs, make a little room\nWe have to shelter from the monsoon.\nWe're not the Meiguo people mama\nTo dump you down the smoky hill,\nSatellite dish on that nice roof,\nChildren going to school. Yes I told her\nWe'd keep her safe from you."}}
