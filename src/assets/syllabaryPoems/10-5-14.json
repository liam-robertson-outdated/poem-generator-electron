{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I'm Dashiell Hammett\nPlayed by Jason Robards\nIn that shack on stilts in salt grass.\nLooking up from my printy underwood\nIn the conjunctival glow\nAt the jowl-grey ocean winter night is working on\nThere's a face like fizz in the glass\nFrom family Christmas dinner snaps:\nHello, granpa."}}
