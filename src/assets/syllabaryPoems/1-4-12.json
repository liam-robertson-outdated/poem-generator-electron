{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Night came into the garden\nThrough the silhouettes of trees,\nExhaling through the grass and crumbs of earth.\nThe dark, for all its strength and sway,\nEncroaches like cockroaches, carrion fowl, habitual notions.\nIt's only the light that breaks and blinds us."}}
