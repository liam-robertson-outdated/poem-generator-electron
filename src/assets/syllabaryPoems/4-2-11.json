{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It mows, the mauves - \nLittle moss-troopers - fall,\nMarsh mallows and spikes,\nMore's the pity. Great moles\nOf rubble shock the hissing\nSwell; they fall too.\nWhat moans in the rigging\nMoans also in pain\nThese are modes of crisis,\nRejection.\nBut THIS is what mourns\nWhen what moulded us once\nLets us down\nAnd moulds us again."}}
