{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "peter McCarey", "text": "The Bruce at Cardross\nIn rough by the links\nAttempts a long-range putt and drops another.\nRight. From the sword-rack extracts\nA double-fisted broad sword bigger than him\nHunkers down like a Cossack - oi! -\nAnd helicopters bracken. He docks nettles,\nDoffs thristles and dots the garth with hacked-off\nLimbs and fronds. I mind Cardross.\nNot a challenging course. They would say\nIt's a doss! It's a skoosh! For the Fair\nWe could stay in the steadings -\nGooseberries and pea-pods under glass.\nCobbled yards, linoleum, iron beds\nThe dross from coal briquettes\nSugar on sour days."}}
