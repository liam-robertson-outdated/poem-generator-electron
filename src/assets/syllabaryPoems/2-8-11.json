{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "There's this:\nWeans or bairns or babes in the digital\nWould get floated on the net bares all; if Goldilocks\nSurvives\nIt's thanks to plantigrade forebearance.\nGreen baize\nAs for snooker, red blaise as in red\nGravel tennis court under your skin. Grow up\nOr try,\nIn fear of the book that blames and gangland blades.\nSophia\nBathes in the world. Sunken bays\nRipple out from her knees. A bloodhound bays;\nJust don't\nGet caught in the braes where she is.\nDawn brailles,\nMonks mumble, brass brays. The gong,\nNo audible attack, still fills your head.\nStrike back\nWith a shinbane whistle.\nAch\nBraids of brains and bladderwrack blains,\nThat's what skulls are full of.\nTrepan:\nIt's only THIS that bails them out.\nReally\nThe last bale's sold to the trapper\nAs we braise the penultimate buffalo\nI see\nThe braves were not so wise.\nC'mon, Sophie:\nBlaze out for us when the ocean blares.\nThe wise are not so brave."}}
