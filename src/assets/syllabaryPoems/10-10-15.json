{"poem": {"title": "Census", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A billion Anglophones, a billion Muslims\nA billion Chinese, a billion Christians\nA billion subcontinentals, one more\nLiving on dust - that's six.\n\nTwo billion ageing, three billion women,\nDire diarrhoea, four billion children\nThe dear dirempt in sunken straits and drier,\nDeconditioned air. The lions hone\nTheir cutter claws and drank the well dry."}}
