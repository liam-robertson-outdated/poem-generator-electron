{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Though pipped at the post the runner-up is a\nLoser. Losers should expect\nTo be wiped out, picked off one\nBy one, pimped out and pricked, however\nThey had primped in finery prinked\nWith gilded studs. Their cheeks\nGet pinched. Their words I will not\nPrint not even in legal footnote\nPitched for microscopes.\nPissed on the eve\nOf someone else's battle, the penultimate Pict\nSquares up to the pit."}}
