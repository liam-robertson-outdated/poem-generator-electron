{"poem": {"title": "Gion", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The character for woman\nAs she knelt to set the table\nPerfectionism tending imperfection\n\nIn the mask of a young girl, she\nWould not see me in my old mac\nA tiddlywink on the go board\n\nNor indeed did I mark her.\nSo the rushmat room, a willow\nBy the bridge, those black canals,\n\nIncense in the hallway,\nPaper lamps at shin height, and\nOh the sudden quiet as I turn a corner now\n\nWill not recur with the character for woman."}}
