{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "That skulk-in-the-grass with the rattling neck\nWould up and crack my nose with its skelfy haft.\nMy nose! Next it's inscribing isobars\nIn gravel courts where they rake in oxblood leaves\nThat the monsoon squanders.\n'I would like to spend two months', says Beckett,\n'In the country, digging holes,\nFilling up each one as I go\nWith the earth from the next'."}}
