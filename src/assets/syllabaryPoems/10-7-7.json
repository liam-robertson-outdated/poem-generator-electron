{"poem": {"title": "Ida Nettleship", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A throw of the dice, a threesome,\nHis sketch of the two young women\nComes back to me like an early prayer.\nThe wife, as sempstress, took up the thread\nWith its reversal, dearth of choice,\nToo many children, death at thirty.\nShe ran to earth, he harvested\nEmpty thunder."}}
