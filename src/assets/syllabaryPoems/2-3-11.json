{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "By my thristly baws, by the wind that blaws and the laws that bend it!\nBuoys will snap their mooring when it rises,\nGarbage bobs or sinks to the blobs of sea anemone.\nBoys ashore kick balls. Their more sophisticated brawls\nMark digital coordinates with bombs.\nBogs erupt, blogs abound. That immolated bonze,\nBawls and howls redacted, liquid boils and solid broils\nI don't know. War bonds, there's a thing.\nWar blondes too. It's not the bronze\nOr golden age. The brazen."}}
