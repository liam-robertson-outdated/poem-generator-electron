{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A rookery rout.\nThe quorum of darkness in judgment.\nPharmacological bends\nIn his winter and summer white wine\nTill we at the requiem roust souvenirs,\nThat he is the root of we can't pull by planting.\nThe taurine voice is rooked,\nHis dream home isn't roofed\nYet, or bought, or the road to it\nMapped. A cosy roost.\nCome and we'll sit in the kitchen."}}
