{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The trees and their location made a grove\nSacred - not to the bugs whose housing schemes\nDisfigured every leaf. And clearly not\nTo those who ground such cynipids to paste\nFor ink. To them the great trees were gall oaks,\nAs though you were known not by or for your name\nBut by your function in some squalid\nUnembraceable economy.\nExcept for folk on pavements\nIn sopping sleeping bags, that\nI have the gall (not mine) to write about."}}
