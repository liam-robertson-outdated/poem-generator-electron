{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It's just a jig, not tsujigiri,\n\"The trying out of a new sword\nOn a chance passer-by\",\nNor is it a jigsaw of, say, Salome,\nCarrying like an icon\nThe missing piece of John the Baptist.\nIt's a jig, just Shiva dancing\nWith the islands round one ankle."}}
