{"poem": {"title": "A CalMac boat", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A CalMac boat will gently bump\nThe pier to say - we're here! Geography stops.\nWith all that glass being flannelled\nYou would think it was a telescope.\nA baritone burp, the newborn baby\nDeflates like a souffl\u00e9\nChin propped up, the two eyes of surprise."}}
