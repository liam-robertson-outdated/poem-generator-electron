{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Seconds away, they kissed and clinched\nThe deal. Hair kinked and crimped, Chan\nTartan kilt, a chest of China,\nLinen, quilt and cutlery. They clinked\nGlasses clipped by hoboes, no,\nBohemians, shied their empties\nOff a cliff. The worst man quipped about\nThe boxers. Then it clicked:\nShe hadn't quit her job, she'd\nKipped on it and got kicked out.\nSo all that flashy kit?"}}
