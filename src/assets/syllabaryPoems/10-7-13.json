{"poem": {"title": "The Slave Trade", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Strange, of all the ships\nI loved the ugliest, the dredger.\nOn the skids, to launch it, smite its bow\nWith a Robertson's Golly jam-\nJar full of frog spawn.\nDug-up funfair\nCranking up its dredge\nAt Central Bridge. Well\nThe Clyde made Glasgow do it\nAnd Glasgow made a right mess of the Clyde."}}
