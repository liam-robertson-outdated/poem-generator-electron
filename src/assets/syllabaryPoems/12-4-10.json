{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "At a port hole\nIn the Laundromat\nOur washing churned\nAnd un-churned.\nThe dish-washer\nMeanwhile\nChugged in its kitchen\nSteady as she goes.\nA hare in the casserole\nJugged and bubbled.\nCut to a Persian\nCentrifuge, or to how,\nIn Dante's sauna,\nWe get judged."}}
