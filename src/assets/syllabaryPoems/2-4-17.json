{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Brusque? He would scrub the event and the venue,\nLeave you to busk on some sub-zero, underground ramp.\nThe buck won't stop, though music might.\nLie looking up: the next bunk is too close to your nose;\nWhat's it to be - some bulk with a club?\nOr a Burke & Hare job? The suspense."}}
