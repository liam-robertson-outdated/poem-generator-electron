{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey / trad ballad", "text": "May Margaret she laughed\nIntil his arms as asleep she lay\nNo joke. All night they'd larked\nBut Clark now lacked a heart\nBeat. The door un-\nLatched, its withers lashed, that\nRide was gone, gone. Lanced\n-\tit's boils you lance, not lovers -\nBy the seventh of her brothers\nAs dawn fog-lamped the chamber\nShe lapsed into awareness\nThe sheet had lapped his blood with hers\nShe has the last word:\nThere'll neither coal nor candle light\nBurn in my chamber evermair."}}
