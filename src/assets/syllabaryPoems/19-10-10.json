{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Was time the wind? That\nWhiled and whittled us\nAway? The ricochet whined,\nPlumbing a space so wide I knew\nI never - for all they'd wired me up to reckon\nAnd wind me up to do - never stood in their\nCrosshairs saying 'cheese',\nWild fear flung into reverse\nBeing what I had."}}
