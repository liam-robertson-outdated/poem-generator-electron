{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Cut rose claw\nRed robes and hooks\nIts spectrum roars\nCome into me.\nBees, being brainless,\nDae as they're tellt\nAnd brave the gale-force\nRootless rogues.\nA witless hero rolls up, rows\nHis dinghy where no signal roams,\nWhere something like Dmitri Shostakovich\nRoves the Beaufort scale.\nHe shouldn't have left the roads. He just\nShould never have left the roads."}}
