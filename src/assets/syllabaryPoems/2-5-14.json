{"poem": {"title": "Banshee", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "With a gonging blash, the garage door\nGets bashed in by the brash ice.\nGutters blench in water brash. Branches\nFrom the garden banished\nSlowly climb\nDown their etymology\nPast Byzantium\nTo the feet of beasts,\nTo the pads and claws of animals."}}
