{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Kith is thicker than water,\nThicker than porter, older than blood.\nA crith of a life will last - a slither of\nGold from the lith of a finger\nInto the zither of the tilth,\nFound by a smith in the horse's mouth.\nThe filth is buried with us, and our rhythm\nDithers and goes. The pith of our decision\nWithers out by the fifth or sixth \"begat\".\nIf anything survives the hither and\nThithering waters of - it's pure gold, pure myth."}}
