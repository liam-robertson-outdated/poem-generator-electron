{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "All in all a bad gig:\nSome prat, I mean some wozzek\nPalped the thing in the\nTarpaulin. Did it no\nGo into spasm? We'd\nThe safety drill off pat\nBut stiffs are just not meant to pant.\nYou harvest bits and plant the wrapping,\nThe remains. We'd planked some spares.\nTurns out they'd rise to\n'plashed', 'pranced'\nwhere in fact they were parched and crottled,\nsore patched up, past repair.\nBut that's language for you: part\nTrap, part valve, a pact with the void.\nWe packed them down in preterite,\nParked them in the undercroft\nTill all their tension passed."}}
