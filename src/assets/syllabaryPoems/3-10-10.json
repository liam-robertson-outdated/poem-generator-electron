{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The thing is primed and glossed,\nThe syllable prised apart, the pie-eyed poet\nPlied with drink and heaped or piled with praise,\nRolled in a rug and trampolined.\nHe pined for the days when collectors prized his work\nAnd no one pried.\nWet wedges, heavy as Balzac,\nSlung on flimsy, patent straps:\nThe penitential finery of women \u2013 \nIt isn't about men\nOr for their pride."}}
