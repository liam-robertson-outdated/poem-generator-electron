{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The drunks are tanking up. A real man\nDuffs up his partner, while on campus\nThe dux dumps the dunce.\nShe dunks him one last time\nThen dusts him off her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nHe ducks out of her life, not realising\nThat's what's happened. Dunts a pillar,\nDoesn't care. A murmur in its ear,\nThe dusk's taken him in so gently."}}
