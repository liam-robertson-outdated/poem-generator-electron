{"poem": {"title": "For Douglas Oliver", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Douglas the grey\nDandelion wraiths\nOf tethered  smoke\nLook\nThe slow\nMosquito spiral\nUnravels\nAfrica\nIn memory\nIn me.\n\nI've eaten bread and olives\nHere for you for me\nDrunk one of those\nWell-marketed, indifferent beers\nThe garden's drunk on thunder.\nJust a sec..\n\nExcuse me, but\nTo think of that\nDumb zek\nHis grasping poetry\nAnd you the radical\nExile and dissenter.\nHappy man!\n\nThe temperate lilac bush\nBeckons grey\nAnd purple of thunder.\nA bead curtain held aside\nOn a place of delicate sounds and scents\nFor you. Who'll light your way\nTo the land of the blind."}}
