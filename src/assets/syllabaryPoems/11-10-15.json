{"poem": {"title": "Pause", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "As her Achilles tendons lay on his\nLike a bow on the fiddle string\nWaiting for a nod from the conductor\nThat had sidled off for breakfast\nWith the second violin, the brass and timpani,\nWho would sire a silence on their memory?\nThe squire and escutcheon waiting on an empty runway\nFor every leafy tournament, for every spire of green."}}
