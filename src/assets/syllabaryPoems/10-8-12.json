{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "How DO you play ducks and drakes?\nDuuh, fast and loose.\n\t\t\tI'm not talking style.\nWell, on a dais at an ashen board with velvet drapes,\nLike battleships with morphemes or the stones of dates as counters.\nSlow and tight, on second thoughts, and daith's the banker."}}
