{"poem": {"title": "From a Louse", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Great poet o the puddin race!\nGet that grin aff your pin-up face.\nTo harbour me is no disgrace\nFor any lady:\nIt's rare to pioneer a place\nNo ploughed already!\n'Tae see oursels as others see us'?\nThat's common sense. That's the police -\nHauf blin (take that fae one wi feelers\nIn the back o's heid).\nCrazed banes! I hear your thin blood wheeze\nYou'll soon be deid."}}
