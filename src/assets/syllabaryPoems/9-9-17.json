{"poem": {"title": "Busking", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "On some kind of xylophone yards and yards long\nLike playing a stretch of the Capetown to Salisbury railway on its teak sleepers\nAnd all the trains that had thundered over the fishplates\nAnd all the folk who looked out from those trains, rapt,\nListening, lost."}}
