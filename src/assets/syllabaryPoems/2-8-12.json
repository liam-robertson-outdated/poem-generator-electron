{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We share a house, a home, a base. I do\nThis walking bass routine to work.\nThe breaks are partly planned and\nPartly not the kind of thing\nGoes through my mind as - brakes!\nThe car's a curling stone. Brace.\nBeside the borehole\nSomeone baits a hook and pats the hipflask\nWhere winter bakes the river hard\nAnd bastes the ice with snow."}}
