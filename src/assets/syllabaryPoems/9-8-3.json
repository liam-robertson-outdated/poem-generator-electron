{"poem": {"title": "Referendum Day 3", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Irrefutable, and unconvincing,\nsaid David Hume of Bishop Berkeley's argument\nthat a tree unseen by anyone in a wood\nis undemonstrable and does not exist.\nHume wouldn't let in God for the trees to root in His attention,\nnor would he let the leprechaun of reason from his grip,\nbut the thought that those elaborate dendrological arrangements\nwere a class that snapped to attention when the teacher turned\nfrom the board\nmust have driven him crackers (I can see him in the staffroom).\nDon't fret: the raptor that patrtols Ben Vorlich\nbrings great clefts of pine to be as it seeks out other things;\nthe cushioned thump at the back of the woodpecker's skull,\nthe stuck of sap when it wags itself like a dog that grips a stick,\nthe ramp and tilt of slaters in the gullies of its bark\nsuggest that, yes, the tree is there. Says Berkeley, 'show it to me!'\nI can't. and when I fly away from Scotland,\npacking it carefully down in cotton wool for another year,\nwhen I think of it, near as old as any tree,\nam I using a Roman stone for a step? Is this the last\nlight from a done star reeling into my eye like a measuring tape?"}}
