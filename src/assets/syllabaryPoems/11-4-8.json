{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He took the sun and swung it\nRound his heid and slung it\nOwre the low hills west of Langholm.\nWhat makars did back then! The other stars\nTrummelt till his rant was sung to silence.\nIt might have been meningitis, ken,\nHis spinal cord high strung at best\nAnd something to stun or astonish his system\nStung him. He'd sprung a leak, spun out of line."}}
