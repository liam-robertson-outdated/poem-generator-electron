{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Nobody heard the big boom. By the time\nThings had cooled down enough for a life\nFor the bloom of a thousand policemen, mechanics\nWas kind of old hat (though it worked)\nDust in the broom. Who'd have thought\nA bomb could create its own target\nThen miss it?"}}
