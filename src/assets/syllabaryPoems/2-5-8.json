{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A trail of spelt and  bran spilt by the strawman\nSnapped up by the birds of the air left just this\nCursive trace. The bang\nYou didn't hear as he missed a barn\nDoor (again) brought calls\nFor a ban on recreational sales\nOf field artillery."}}
