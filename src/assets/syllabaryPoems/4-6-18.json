{"poem": {"title": "Mills of God", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The windmill was my toffee apple on a stick\nThe scandalous got drowned with a millstone round their neck;\nBut what drove a watermill, why a click mill clicked,\nWhat a pepper mill processed or a paper mill produced\nI couldn't say, in the mirl of the metaphor,\nIn the militant glory of god\nWhere the men with the millstones explode\nAnd the homicide bombers upload some deal\nWe're supposed to approve and applaud as a secular\nJudaeo-Christian jihad (for gas)\n\nA mill's a thing for grinding grain to powder.\nWhat's a war for?"}}
