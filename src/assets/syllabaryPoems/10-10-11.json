{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The dyer's hand has auburn cuticles: would you believe it?\nThe chief technical officer dyes his hair.\nHe'll have one o thae 1960s helmet driers they used on wifies\nThat dried their tongue to stop their gossip. Not his:\nHe drives an orotund coach and horses through discussions,\nDives in at the deep end, yah yah yah.\nDines on ancient anecdotes worth at most a dime a gross.\nHis missus dials and rings an empty office. Dies alone."}}
