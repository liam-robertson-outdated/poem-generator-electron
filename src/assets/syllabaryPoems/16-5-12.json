{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Why glance at me in a stranger\nThrough the glass, the greener grass?\nIt grants you a keener self;\nIt grafts an actionable desire on nothing much.\nNothing much: graphs superimposed on graphs\nThat somehow grasps that's all it is\nAnd gasps at pain and pleasure. Here you are.\nGaps in awareness coin the individual,\nRandom facts - they don't gas fish in China,\nEtcaetera - clownish gaffes in company\nThat gaffs you with a spike when you don't watch it.\nHurricanes are cloisters where powers meditate.\nThe eyes are cloistergarths, where wells reflect."}}
