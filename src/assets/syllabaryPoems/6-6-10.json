{"poem": {"title": "Their Favourite Things", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Clingfilmed Cadillac, shark finned and grinned\nWith Frigidaire doorhandles.\nIvy-League widows, defrilled and deskilled\nFrigged and fulfilled, who fibbed and stayed true\nTo whisper-fridged kitchens and soft-figged shade\nChoc-full of goodies that\nFizzed and frizzed in contact with the heat\nThey couldn't take."}}
