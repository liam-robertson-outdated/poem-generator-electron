{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Popes and their rituals\nPoets and rivals\nAuthority. Prestige\nPokes and tempts us\nWith so much cholesterol\nSee who porks out\nOn that old seizure salad.\nOne drop of politics, said Blok,\nJust one, of that clarty leaven,\nAnd a song posts itself\nTo the next generation.\nInvoluted ports and havens\nPush it out."}}
