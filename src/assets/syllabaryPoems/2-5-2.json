{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Its sound the hook, its sense the barb\nAnd you the worm unearthed at dawn\nBeside a gravel path, run through and dangled\nIn the stream for a song you never heard\nA parting shot that missed, the clever\nThing you thought of too late to say."}}
