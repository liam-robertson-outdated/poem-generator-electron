{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Qualms on the lochan\nKraals on the veldt\nMorning calms an anxious vigil\nCrags around the village are just that:\nBig stones.\nA script of cams and tappets\nCrabs and seizes over time\nThough it crams with sound and sense\nWith carbs and protein so to speak\nIt clams up.\nHackney cabs leave town, as\nFull as whelks. The clans are gathering\nWhat? Whatever: glacial calves and\nPringle scarves, those cans of Baxter\u2019s soup,\nScotch broth. I wonder who carves off\nThe chewy bits, what cads are scraping gristle\nTo add bulk. Meanwhile the cars return\nAnd gently drool. Morning clads the tower blocks\nIn bling. Whatever cards you're dealt\nYou show your hand, eventually, you\u2019re back\nTo case d\u00e9part, to square one."}}
