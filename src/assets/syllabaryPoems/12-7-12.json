{"poem": {"title": "Endgame", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Do you want to know that the polar bear\nA hundred miles down wind has caught your scent\nAnd you smell like train oil, like inside?\nIt's not a hawk to be moored with a jess of silk.\nCivilian flights are grounded; others\nMake their way to Bethlehem."}}
