{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You don't live like a gerbe on the retina\nBut draw on me till like that pepper jasmine\nFrom the little terracotta you cover the entire wall\nWhere swifts in hundreds skirmish with their shadows\nAnd there's nothing left of me and the birds have gone\nBut you keep wringing bloom from that corded stem"}}
