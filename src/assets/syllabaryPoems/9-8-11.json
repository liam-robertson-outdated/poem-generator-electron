{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Branches don't merge\nAnd rivers don't branch\nAhough rails can do both\nBut not cross - that's\nPaths and swords, stars,\nMaybe bones.\nBones and their off-the-peg, second-hand selves.\nThey're sowing zizania, darnel and vetch,\nHaving rare tares in the wheat: don't stare:\nIt tears, it twains the double turn-gree of the pump\nThey share, the sinuous, twin spine, though note -\nThey've neither impish tails nor that stale\nOlogy which tames the staid and timid\nWho strained but never strayed,\nGod's chosen that trades good for upgrade\nTrays of pink champagne in sleeping cars\nOn trains that travel lines of ice and brittle traves\nWhere trails can run cold as tales with no teller\nAnd there is no grain to go against."}}
