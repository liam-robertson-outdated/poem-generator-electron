{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Little birds negotiating dawn in bad Chinese is what\n(Unless it's that old apnoea) what wakes Don Juan up.\nHe holsters his dong. The mirror has drawn\nHim. Him it is but not just back to front\nAnd that bint on the bed: she looks dead. Hey\nCut. Take two."}}
