{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The sod! She sobbed\nAnd snogged him one last time.\nMark's men had slogged for ever over\nEvidence (and evident it was)\nNow they'd solved it,\nWhich spoiled everything.\nEven her lap-dog soiled its cushion.\nMark stormed into the hut and there they were,\nAsleep in bed, a naked sword between them.\nHe retreated to the greensward. What the fuck?!\nForensics swarmed everwhere, swabbed everything.\nShe swanned off; spawned only gossip.\nHe went and sprawled in his den. On vellum\nScrawled a counterversion. As\nThe heavy squad hit the front door\nHe was sneaking out the back."}}
