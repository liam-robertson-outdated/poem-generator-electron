{"poem": {"title": "Arjuna and Draupadi in Glasgow", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I am the southwest wind\nI salt the air and soak the earth.\nThese ravelled clouds of mine shake out\nthe tenemental warp and weft\nof sulphured sandstone rows.\nA rustheap rolls up, bringing you,\nyou in a saffron thundercloud\nyour heels that press the ochre boards\nas tensile rain hits petals, whose\npubescence tries to hold to it:\nthose drawn bows.\nHere at last I can see neither\nbowstring, wrist nor flight, and so\nmy shot bends like a sleepy fruit\nburns along the fuse you lit\nto its target: war."}}
