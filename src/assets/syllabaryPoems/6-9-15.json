{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Not known, but it could be that the Naragansett\nBrought us the word 'kayak' but, when they sighted\nBoreray in cold eruption from the slanting deep,\nThat votive pyre of gannets seeking some implacable god,\nTurned tail and set the outboard. Though of course, we tracked them home.\nTo commune with the wild is beauty. Fear\nIs when it communes with you."}}
