{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sumptuously drawered as a Louis XV chest, he met the day.\nDaubed silk; yes, quite.\nHe donned a white shift. It dawned on him, now he was dolled up\nTo the nines, one of his men had just drawled back at him.\nThink: dod of mince in the menagerie; tremble\nAnd obey. He'd dodged and counterpunched for forty years;\nNow was he dogged\nWith courtiers too stupid to be scared?"}}
