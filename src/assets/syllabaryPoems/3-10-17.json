{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Clockwork corks! With neither wings\nTo fly nor weight to cut\nWater. They found a slat, their opposite,\nWallowing listless, neither lake nor shore, lined up\nAnd paddled over onto over it, about,\nAnd bobbled back up down again.\nThey didn't notice the pike\nOver a yard long, more than I would lift\nWashed up, protruding from the lake like\nHandle of butcher's knife from inside pocket\nAs I've seen, in Paisley, when the pubs came out,\nSlit just aft of the midriff, where\nA duckling would have gone down nicely.\nThief."}}
