{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Been quite a trek: each stop\nA woodcut in the mud\nOr cursive in the sand\nOr nothing at all\nOn roads and rocks\nCriss-crossed my geodesic\nA ragged web, pyrethrum-soaked\nAnd me the bait mosquitoes get through\nTo. Both laughably low tech,\nMe at least. These lines\nSo seldom caught."}}
