{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The last lady gone, her man is ill - what though\nHe owns the city. Proof of which\nHe lays him down on the random pavement.\nPlain-clothes social security men around him so discrete\nThey don't know who it is or that they're guarding.\nBooze companies spend billions to attract and keep his custom;\nTHe wealthy want assurances, he won't return their calls\nFor he is her man."}}
