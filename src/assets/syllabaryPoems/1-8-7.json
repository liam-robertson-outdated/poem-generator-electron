{"poem": {"title": "Imperial Measure", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "An eighth of an inch, of an hour, of a ton\nOf a note, of a beat, a beatitude,\nWoe to you, cardinal. Ordinal - 8th,\nA catch in the breath. Is it\nOctaves or tens? D'you count thumbs,\nSir Augustus, or months (October's the tenth)\nA catch in the breath\nHalf a stitch, a caesura."}}
