{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Someone has sold the weights from the clock\nSo women work till the men are done.\nWaifs and strays are goods and chattels, offshored\nTo the king of the counting house, who wastes and wants\nYour sixpenny serf who only stands and waits \u2013 \nEven the one whose nose is gone. She wakes,\nHer waist's a little thicker.\nMust be all that bread and honey."}}
