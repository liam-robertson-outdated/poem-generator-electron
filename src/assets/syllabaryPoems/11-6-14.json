Now that would be\nMasonic squaring of the circle,\n'trompe' in French. A trumpery.\nBut don't change the subject.\nBeetles in the wrong place\nAs the keystone\nFound its slot: we squish them.\nSwish of curtain ring on rail, and look:\nThe place is empty. All that\nSacrifice. Now you\nWere going to grant me a wish."}}
