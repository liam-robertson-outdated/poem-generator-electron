{"poem": {"title": "Sloth", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Well if on the wheel of life you all get\nHammocked on the rim\nOf course you wake up fiddling. Just try\nShut-eye when you're hugging one of the spokes.\nAnd who shall we say invented that device?\nThe green-eyed greed, the two-toed wrath."}}
