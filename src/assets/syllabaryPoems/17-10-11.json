{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "In colder climes\nHe'd have found no public space to scandalize.\nHis crimes get published\nIn the clattering quires of newsprint.\nHe climbs to the utmost branches,\nKyles and roadsteads scroll beneath him.\nHis cries are lost\nIn the glittering splendour of the choirs."}}
