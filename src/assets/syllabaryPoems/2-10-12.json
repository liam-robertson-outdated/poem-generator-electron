{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "When does a system fail? What blights and cures,\nWhat bites then licks is salt and savage.\nThe taste of blood interrogation might arouse\nSmoking out wasps in bruckle bykes in lofts,\nPrising millibytes of misintelligence from heads\nAt camps on the bights of Benin, for example, or Okhotsk.\nI've seen city states like racing bikes with mandoline-string spokes\nAnd the rust outrun them."}}
