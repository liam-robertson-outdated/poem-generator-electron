{"poem": {"title": "Collateral (for Chris McCabe)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "From The Port (Port Glasgow) to the Fragrant Port\n(Hong Kong) we run, and back to Liverpool\nWith Chinese cash for Indian opium\nAs Hong Kong's Finest pepper-sprays umbrellas\nAmong blocks that, for a moment, coincide\nWith a 3-D chart of the pussy-grabber's chances\nTonight.\nIn a Hollywood Road antique shop I pick up\nA Han dancer, then set him down real slow\nWhen I see the string of zeroes on the price tag;\nIt is pre-Christian. Would we be post?\nI could see you lead me out the shop, explaining\n'There's meth in his oddness, madam.' She is fey,\nBut not fatale, by the way, miss mystery;\nAnother bard that likes her cover deep.\nAre we the infiltrators? With the twist,\nOn the Boston remake of the Kowloon film,\nThat we don't remember who we're working for.\nYou Tony Leung, no longer 'In The Mood', me\nMartin Sheen, about to demonstrate\nThat vertigo, like paranoia, can have a point.\nWe come out well but not, I fear, alive."}}
