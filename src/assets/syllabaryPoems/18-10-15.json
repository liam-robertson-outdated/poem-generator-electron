{"poem": {"title": "Hierogram", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Higher into the dark\n(My vertebrae rattling like a pile of soup plates)\nOf your eyes,\nRock rabbit\nLolloped in from another tale;\nIn Abyssinian\nAshtok, where the pharaoh's scribe\nPut his hieratic\nBest foot forward. Hire a car\nAnd drive, man, drive."}}
