{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "La petite mort, they say. Preceded by\nAn hour of 'flu and a minute of epilepsy.\nWhy would I want to take a lovely woman there?\nI do. But today it's just the flu. As though I'd met my critics\n(I have some now. It's rather sweet)\nWithout knee-pads and helmet (sorely missed),\nSkiing gloves, a hockey sock and shin pad of my dad's,\nThe greave of a legionnaire, et caetera.\nI lie here thinking 'Grieve, with a name like yours\nI wouldn't change it.'"}}
