{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sex is mental\nMostly. Sperm's\nPyjama papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9\nSmells. The stalks\nAnd stems are blatant,\nBut cells? Your\nSelf-fulfilling spells?\nWhat swerves and swells\nLike that is meant\nWho says? - Is meant \nTo be - not necessarily\nCalfskin suedes or scrimshawed\nWhalebone sleds. But it\nServes and orders, sells time\nFor something."}}
