{"poem": {"title": "A Day Job", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He'll coax them into the close, whose wattage\nCloaks more than it shows:\nTwo coats of emulsion, coarse as cabbage.\nThe back courts? A midden.\nOne quotes the prospectus: colts in the paddocks,\nCroaks in the pond. No fungus.\nNot that he coasts along with this, of course.\nLet's say he copes."}}
