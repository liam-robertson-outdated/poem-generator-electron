{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Hot skin on a hard flame\nA string of saxophone\nExpletives in a husky voice\nOver a buzz that doesn't sting.\nIt's a swing state, this:\nSing, and it gets parsed\nTo sin and prayer;\nThe music - cotton-tempered rhetoric.\nSling woe, my sweet,\nAnd that old kit bag\nOut the chariot. Spin me some shellac.\nThe dishwasher stinks; it must be spring."}}
