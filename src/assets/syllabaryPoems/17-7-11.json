{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The Book of Kells - all special effects\nAnd empty faces. Calligraphers\nShould keep to the kerbs with their skateboard tricks,\nTheir doodles to the margin. Instead of\nOrdering kegs of cochineal klegs from the ancient east,\nThey might have learned how art\nThat kens and quells distraction\nCan engineer this confrontation."}}
