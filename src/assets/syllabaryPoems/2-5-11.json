{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The banns are read, the groom brags\nI got Morka! Platinum bands get swapped\nHe bags the dowry. Bras and pants of listed\nBrands no longer cover one prosthesis\nAnd one dysfunction. Oh well.\nBut sure the little barbs and balms of medicine ...?\nI see. He bans all mention. Someone blabs. The nation's\nBars hear talk of nothing else till the football game.\nBarns are full of wind. The chaff\nAnd bran's been sold with the wheat, as bards proclaim\nMorka the big stick, Morka\nThe biggest pussy of them all."}}
