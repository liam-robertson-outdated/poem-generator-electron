{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Up the cleats to a crow's nest\nThat creeps in from the ocean on a fog\nTo whummel creeks and bays. \nCliques of gannets; no wind.\nThe wood creaks.\nKnife-edge crease in linen, here he's\nHeading home for good. The old man's\nComing home for keeps."}}
