{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I've worn a rut between two gists\nOn the road to Compostela: home and work.\nTwo jiffs and it jilts me\nLike the fiddler's wife a pilgrim.\nDear St Jinx, Would you gypse it for me?\nAs it jinks John Calvin's town of stone and chintz,\nDown the Rhone,\nHoly Highway 61\nThe sun unrolls\nA silk road over the sea.\nWhere's my stick and scallop?\nWhere's my faith and freedom?"}}
