{"poem": {"title": "Suffrage", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"We Americans can do something great in November\nOr we can do something absolutely terrible and then live with the shame.\"\n\nThe poor boy and prole are evicted, enlisted. For them\nThe political poll dance, the minor mazurka is done.\n\nAs I lay in the Byron Hotel,\nIn the lane where they shot Kapodistrias,\nWe were texted at sun-up: the man one."}}
