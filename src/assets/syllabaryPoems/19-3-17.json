{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We walk, that's what we do. We walk and think.\nBig head, slim hips, tough parturition. We inflict.\nInfliction is our thing. Stir-fry the biosphere.\nSome wonk says Man may not survive\nBut life will. Cool. Fire off some bugs\nA megacolony of hardy beetles; lots of dung\nAnd beetle juice; a dictionary and wiki rocket science.\nBy the time they reach the nearest plausible planet\nThey'll have sussed which way is up."}}
