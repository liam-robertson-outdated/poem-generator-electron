{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "But shouldn't it start from nothing, not from words?\nIt does: they talk to me\nThen they shut up and we all listen -\nWell, most of us. Loose talk cost the lives of pagan gods\nSunlight spelunking, looking for a human bud to nip.\nThey're no great loss. Unless they've taken realms of silence with them,\nSequestering almost all but the name of poet."}}
