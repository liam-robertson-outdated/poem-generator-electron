{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I'm going to buy a shaw\nClear some larch and pine in the middle\nBuild a house like the Quakers in New England\nWi nary a nail nor drop of glue\nBut joints that settle till they're more like grafts\nAnd I'll stay there till it's four hundred year old\nAnd me a sprightly ninety\nHearing the breakers braille the rocks at Cleadale."}}
