{"poem": {"title": "Nocturne in B flat Minor", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Encre de Chine, India ink\nThree smokestacks do invisible\nLetters home.\nNo moonbeam runs that Chaplin\nDeck-chair foldage routine, on\nThis temple floor of an afterdeck.\nThrough indigo silk-\nen time her little face\nUnbuckles to the sulky sky.\nThose Saigon tars on the mess deck smoke\nSlick opium. The Marseilles soap\nSits pungent in its paper frock.\nConclusions settle\nBrine on her lip . . .\n\tAm I the only one leaving\nIndochina? Well she might have wondered\nTill the pianist came on shift\nAnd loosened up - a touch\nAnachronistically - with Autumn Leaves\nThen, pending requests for that tune by the Duke\n(Did ever you see that baby dance?)\nHe summed the situation up with Chopin\nwhich caught her wrist\nas a Geiger counter draws the user\ncloser to the source.\n\tShe's crying now\nMagic salt cruet\nLost by that silly boy\nIn the bed of the sea."}}
