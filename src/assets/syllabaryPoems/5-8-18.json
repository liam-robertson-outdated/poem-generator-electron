{"poem": {"title": "Salvage Arena", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle\n\nThe Holy Ghost was a baldy man like Mr Lynn, the electrician\nRadio broadcasts snagged like wool in brambles, fog condensing,\nOr pearls in the trawl of Spanish lace my mother wore to mass.\nThat was a mantilla - it was not the veil of tears\nFrom which Totheedowe sent up our sighs, mourning and weeping.\nIt's not what you know, it's who you know\nMy mother's mother said, with such disgust\nWe knew what she meant, though not who she meant.\nI know now. I know them now. And their sticky networks.\nThe vale of tears was the World, the veil of Maya\nAnd every salty drop of it is wiped away."}}
