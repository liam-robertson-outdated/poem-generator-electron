{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sap recedes. The boughs of the beech\nRise out of reach, again. Why hang round\nTo be insulted? Slap of December,\nChildren suddenly too clever,\nThe scarp of beauty - steep. Zap it\nAnd the other channel's deid. So\nStamp in the cold snap. Clutch at the littlest\nScrap of that tingle in the scalp,\nFraying strap."}}
