{"poem": {"title": "The Ice-cream Cone Belongs to Me", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "From a land of rancid rites\nYou're tired of rice in begging bowls,\nPiss-poor poets and pisspot songs\nSo you writes to the man:\nTo go with the obligations, we want rights\nAnd big-league earnings, huh? A shipwright's ransom.\nGive me the free beer, you dull dumb-asses."}}
