{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Shrimps and other bottom feeders\nLaunder shits for beds of lettuce.\nDeathbed shrifts are short; the clerical\nShrinks just want them done by the book.\nWe're all upcycled gradually\nFrom gravel beds and schists\nTill the wind, as it will, shifts,\nAnd the hull ships all that water."}}
