{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Swimming through the ribcage of the whale\nTo leave the krang behind.\nIf you can, why don't you? Eh?\nThe snow recedes like a banker's hairline. Clang!\nYou have 30 seconds, starting\nNow. What connects the peaks across the valley\nTo the price in the local 'tique shop of\nA water jug, a yoke and brick\nbed platform heated underneath? Hint:\nAlpine real-estate futures. Wrang!\nTwo crate of lobster in the boot of a Bentley.\nOh to be - just somewhere else\nWhen the gowfers motor in, them and their wee dugs.\nYou'll mind the Clan McCann - especially Genghis."}}
