{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "This one sagged into gravity,\nSnagged on a thorn. Sad\nIt's scarred for life.\nRoses reared and sparred on a breath of breeze\nSparrows slagged each other off.\nCar door slammed. A masked man\nGot stabbed outside a shop. Tinned beans were scarce\nBut who'd have starved? The sinner\nSalved his scabbed and crottled conscience:\nHe should have scrammed when tellt,\nBut that's him slabbed. A skald\nScanned the foreshore, spanned the firth and starred\nThe north, its soggy strand, a stricken\nStand of pine. Water running out and,\nThrough his fingers, sand."}}
