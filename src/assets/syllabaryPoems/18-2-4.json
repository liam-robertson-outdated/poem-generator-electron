{"poem": {"title": "Home", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It could be in Islamabad or Rome\nOr the house we got in Switerland,\nFor home, like poems of mine read out\nBy people I won't know,  isn't even\nSome place I remember. It's\nWherever you bed down, alone or with me,\nDemanding 'sustainable cuddles' like a good wee\nBureaucrat, warming your soles against my shins.\nA boat hove to, as if we could make\nA port of any storm, though one we won't,\nThere'll yet be room beside me. Yours."}}
