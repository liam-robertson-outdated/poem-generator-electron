{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The herder had hardly got his ox to lumber along the path\nTill its shoulders surge as sea-swell, bristling auks and guillemots;\nSo much for zen. He bobs along with the compass-orts for oars.\nDick Tracy was drawn to look like John Wayne, not a razorbill;\nSo much for comics. He stops his options and subscriptions.\nThe world is control, psy-ops and samsara. He offs it.\nSo much for that."}}
