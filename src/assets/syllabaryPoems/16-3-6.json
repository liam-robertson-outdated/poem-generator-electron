{"poem": {"title": "The Reverend Uncle", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Eighteen is not a theological number:\nIt's seven sacraments times the three\nPersons, less the Trinity - id est nothing.\nThe rough, not roughage, isn't purgative,\nThe fairway neither paradise nor primrose\nPath to the sandy pit. His nephew\nIs equally clueless with cruets and woods,\nSo let's admit the caddy IS an acolyte\nAnd that - so hotly denied it's likely true -\nHis bowling parishioner's right arm\nAs he genuflects moves stiffly back.\nDoes HE, though, clasping the crafted stem,\nBowed intent on that little white diameter,\nThink of mass? Unlikely. If he ever did\nHe'd put it, like this, aside without a grimace\nAnd go on to concede his old pal Paddy Tierney\nA two-inch putt for par."}}
