{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A sack of spuds\nA shelf of skulls\nA book of stubs\nA book of Kells\nA jig of slurs\nA jigger of suds\nA drawer of studs and cuff-links\nA quiver of real or imagined slights and snubs\nA laundry bag of scrubs\nA can of squirms\nThe stone he stuns the fish with\nSlugs of the Order of Merit\nSurds and sums\nA contract signed by McQuitty and Sons\nTo honour. Perhaps.\nThe songs he strums on envelopes\nThe biro scuds across in dingy snugs\nOn weekday afternoons. The barman stirs\nA bloody mary, for his breakfast. Tudor crisps\nAre on the house. The sun is hot\nBut not in Glasgow. Not today."}}
