{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What a sight.\nTar in the slight\nStarlight in the shiver\nOn site hard hat.\nThe smith'll smite\nThat flange with a skite\nAnd sparks'll fly in spite\nBecause or not - but I forgot\nThe Sprite, its silver breath,\nIts three-ton, tincan whisper,\nIts ornamental console. So\nForget it. Go\nTo the striped and spotty workers,\nThe gossip-sniped and credit swiped.\nYou tell them: this poem\nIt's yours. I serve it\nSliced in lines and spliced with syntax,\nSpiced with a certain tu ne sais quoi\nAnd spiked with viscous vodka."}}
