{"poem": {"title": "\"Buenos Aires: Ex-dictator on child-abduction charges\"", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Three drops of rain on my back\nAs I was throwing out the children's cot\nThe playpen and the bags of clothes.\n\"Zero to six\" it said, meaning months:\nYears back then were unthinkable.\n\nThree drops of rain on my back\nFrom the storm on a campsite over the mountain\nConnections we make, quick as thinking - Now\nTwenty years after abduction at birth\nOf babies from blindfolded prisoners\n\nThree drops of rain on my back. I was tortured\nWith my little failure to love\nWhile people like me were being dumped in the Atlantic\nIn case they upset the account I'm paid from -\nThis globe. Good old Henry Kissinger."}}
