{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Just as, when the interpretation's rubbish,\nThe chief interpreter puts his headphones down\nAnd rubs the bridge of his nose with index finger and thumb,\nI'd set aside the yoke of collarbone and shoulderblade\nAnd wriggle back into the original egg, an unmade bed,\nAt four on a winter's morning,\nThe sunrise yolk reconstituted, the bleary white, divided\nYin and yon, yirsel division cataracting\nThrough family albums to primal stew\nCuddling to keep warm, each with a finger in the other's ear\nTo stop the alarm clock."}}
