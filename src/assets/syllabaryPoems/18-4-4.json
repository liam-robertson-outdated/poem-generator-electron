{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "First night in their suburban house\nOn a shelf above the Seine\nWe were feasting late;\nSomething let off.\nToo foul for a fart. Turned out\nThe inside bend contained\nA metropolitan sewage plant,\nThe gong farm. Hold your hooter\nOne a.m. each night it would honk and hum."}}
