{"poem": {"title": "Die the Death", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"With the delegates sat there like a choir of jam jars\nhe dropped this ring in my hand without a glance\nas he got up and walked towards their captain\nsaying maybe we could talk this out. And that, of course,\nwas the last of him till he turned up in the market\nunder the butcher's stall. I believe the ring's for you.\"\n\tOr:\nTook two in the gut at a time and place in town\nwhere even strays would have had ulterior motives.\nOne journalist maintains it was for lines\non gullets slit for \"la francophonie\".\nThe coroner found hookworm. His widow\nfound grandchildren, but orphaned, and her son\ndidn't know what to do with the African statues,\ncheap copies that they were, in rotten wood."}}
