{"poem": {"title": "Host", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "This is when, on moorland, a foot\nGoes through to some kind of cyst.\nWalk into a box of voices\nCrowded as long wave at night,\nTalk with no pause and no breath\nThat none could have hoped to refute.\nAnd music's the hoofprint of the silence you've lost."}}
