{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Grandiloquent, thick squall, you sabred\nScrawl on the biosphere, earth's every small\nTrinket a-creak on your stall.\nChatter and dine in clubland; kettle and spall revolt.\nThey can't spoil a ballot you've already fouled\nIn electoral shell games\nTo privatise profit and nationalise debt."}}
