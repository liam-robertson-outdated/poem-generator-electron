{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "First-person shooter snipes from his hide hits nothing.\nMadame, though, when she smites, he's smitten.\nSwipes his card and skites, as in shoots the craw.\nHe skypes her number, nothing. Which strikes him as odd, shouldn' t.\nSpikes in her hair now, she's one of those sprites.\nOn some derivative sites and shows they'd splice a tail and\nSalamander stripes. But she's the spice,\nThe spikenard. Spite's not her thing - his maybe.\nHe'll slice an onion paper thin and read\nThe world through that Book of Sights,\nFoxed as it is with real and imagined slights."}}
