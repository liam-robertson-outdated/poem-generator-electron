{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I was there with the Shahs of Shiraz\nWith the shamans and shams of Siberia\nSat on their red rugs and shags\nIn the red rubble shards of the high road.\n\nJust one of the cup bearers hadn't attracted their ribaldry;\nSuch beauty and force: how could they not have noticed at all?\nI lifted a glass. She approached, and I covered its rim.\nWould you do me a favour? She waited. Stay just as you are\n\nFor ever. She looked. The rest of the scene disappeared:\nSociety, sex, the red carpet, my language and bearing.\nFor ever, she said, in your memory. Turned on her heel.\nNow I'm tired of this tankard that brims as soon as I drain it \n(da capo)"}}
