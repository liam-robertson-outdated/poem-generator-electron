{"poem": {"title": "Redundant", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He was 'in good tid' this once\nHe'd timmed his gloom with the tidy bin.\nTrimmed and filed his nails as a government\nGoon trilled on the box.\nDinner of spuds and tinned\nMonosodium glutamate owre the sink\nThen tilled the Herald crossword,\nTirled at clues between his teeth\nTwirled a biro round his index\nFinger till he twigged:\n'Turbulent river rose to fill it'?\nReservoir. Not bad.\nThough some were tinged with doubt.\nHe'd worked in a town - a boat-yard, really,\nTwinned to the place that\nMade the paddle\nHe was up shit creek without."}}
