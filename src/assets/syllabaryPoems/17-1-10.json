{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She'd hung out with a crude crowd,\nKind of thing that could cloud your daylights\nAnd did. Pigeons cooed and clattered in the spring\nNo longer cowed by the hoodies, cowled crows\nThat toyed with dinner, clowned with carrion.\n\nI could have crowned her, so I could\nBut ach, she was crewed wi her ain deils\nThat cruised the organization in her.\nShe did get cured, smoked out, but they came back\nIn spades and squads, squared and cubed,\n\nTill she was just a voice, cued for a song,\nWearing that elegant shape with such neglect\nWe queued around the block to see her."}}
