{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Toy yachts in the lens of the pond, coaxed out\nLike milk teeth; jib and mainsail\nCut from granpa's vest.\nThe breeze it would take to fill\nWould coup the keel. So it goes\nJust beyond recall. Propelled\nBy Brownian motion, solar wind and the quiet ocean."}}
