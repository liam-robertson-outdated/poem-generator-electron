{"poem": {"title": "If It Please Your Honour", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Guilty pleas are easy\nBut when a man pleads not guilty\nThe counsel for the prosecution preens:\nIt's story time.\nCan the accused deny that every Wednesday in Lent\nHe pees in the soup to peals of mirth from his delinquent peers?\nThe defendant can and does:\nThe peas in the soup are as in fog\nWhere evidence is murky\nWhere even silks are sulky.\nHe peels his cataracted lenses and peers in."}}
