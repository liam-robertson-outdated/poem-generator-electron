{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Keeps a tawse in his inside pocket\nToys with it, quick on the draw.\nThat isn't elbow-patch material:\nMore like a boot sole. The B class\nToils in delta S for silence.\nRed-hot tongs, he's thinking, used to shed\nDim light on trolls and unter-\nMenschen in their hemp and leather togs. The saints\nIn trons and dungeons were delivered\nFrom this world with such forceps.\nSuch were the martyrs'\nTerms of reference."}}
