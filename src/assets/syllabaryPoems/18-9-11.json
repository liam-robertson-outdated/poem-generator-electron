{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Slight list to port. Two shots of fino\nSlide down  the bar. She heeds her instinct, takes\nHis glass. Here's to you. Fresh air? Up on deck\nHe's blacking out. She bends to adjust her sling-backs\nheaves him up from the shins\nAnd over the rail. Who hears a splash?\nAnd that gouge on her wrist, wake on an oily reach \u2013\nThe vessel heals."}}
