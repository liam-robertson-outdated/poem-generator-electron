{"poem": {"title": "Diaz (for Pietro Cardines)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The Colonel's face was usually set to say \"bosh\";\nWhen he came to the kirk,\n\"The married man lives like a dog\",\nHe said to the groom, \"And dies like a king;\nFor bachelors, it's the other way round.\"\n\nSo this year the General wed\nA shipbuilder's widow and wastrel son\nAnd they didn't want him for his wit\nAs he had the wit to see, too late,\nAnd die, this day, like a dog."}}
