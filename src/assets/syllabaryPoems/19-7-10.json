{"poem": {"title": "for M.C.", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The ring you wed me with got wedged\nAs round a cormorant's gullet,\nEtching the webbed\nFolds between three fingers,\nFast as any weld,\nAs us, I guess, for all that's welled up\nAnd whelmed us more than once\nAs to the source\nWe wend."}}
