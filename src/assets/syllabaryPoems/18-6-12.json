{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Hicks from the stacks and a sherry tutorial\nTux from the Styx of that old school slurry.\nIn it up to the hilts.\nSixties hits on the one hand,\nSubtle hints on the other\nGuide her hips.\nIs this a point where I lost my way\nOr crossed it? Lost a life?\nIn the cold of a sepulchre, coal gas heaters hiss."}}
