{"poem": {"title": "Thyme", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What I loved (I see it now) was the dichotomy -\nA physical change is reversible, a chemical change is not;\nLab 1 for the perfect tense, lab 2 for preterite -\nThat I dropped for Russian grammar. Going east\nTime loses grip through Turkestan, till China\nHas no tense at all: it's red shift and jet lag.\nParticles released from a sprig held fast\nIn three dimensions (index, middle and opposable thumb);\nA cloud of tweets that a bird with lungs for heart\nConfesses to some notary."}}
