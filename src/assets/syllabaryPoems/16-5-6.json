{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Graf Morgen, Clermont, Sunday,\nPlots against us.\nNot like the officers of night\nWho hold as robbers heights they got as sycophants.\nYet will he station coffee cup and croissant\nLike chessmen\nAnd smile at the telling gaffe.\nHe won't give up\nTill we gaff him. He holds\nThe sun should ever rise. But past the zenith -\nInto what? Plot a graph, Count: see it dwine.\nHis Excellency, not unlike Catania,\nRebuilt from what erased it\nTime and again."}}
