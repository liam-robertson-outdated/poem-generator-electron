{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A film about a paedophobe\nGone short of medication\nOn the dole, in a derelict building,\nAnd the one with the 2nd-hand teddy bear\nDoesn't know not to talk to uncle.\nAnd I had to stay till the end,\nWhich was not so droll,\nFor the young director had come all the way\nFrom Seoul to present it\nAnd he looked so happy,\nAnd his partner so pretty,\nI didn't want to spoil their night by walking out."}}
