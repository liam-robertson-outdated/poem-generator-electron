{"poem": {"title": "for Ian Colclough", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Was it the drowning eight years later\nMemorised that first attempt\nAt verse \"Too late, he's dead!\" the bosun cried;\nSorrowful silence was our reply.\nI hear a swizz, a ripple, something\nAwful in that latter line.\n- But I've done worse since, and a good friend lies\nTwenty-eight years under, as I live."}}
