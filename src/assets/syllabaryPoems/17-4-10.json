{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "They culled the individualists\nAnd clubbed the demonstrators;\nReal fear curbed the old intelligentsia.\nThe train from Moscow to Vladivostok\nTook five minutes short of a week.\nA straight line from one to the other\nWould have gone down a steep cellar stair\nBut they clung to the curved face of the earth\nThe curd and the honey, the pasture and cud.\nQueues, as for the sacrament, shuffled and\nCurled on every public space of the Soviet Union."}}
