{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The Church and State that paired them off preyed on them.\nTheir relics paved the road to Paradise, since privatised.\nThey left a house, no debt, and goods enough\nTo stop a travelling-rug on a windy beach \u2013 \nNot that they pared things down\nOr that worldly clutter pained them; it's just\nMost of what we were or did\nPaled with the Rothesay suntan\nOr got planed and sanded out.\nFor the sins of the fathers they sought indulgence,\nFor ours they paid up front:\nWe prayed together all the time.\nAnd though he was more team sports and she piano,\nWe played together too."}}
