{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Clouds offload at the pass, move on.\nClowns at customs stood in grey\nCrowds of witness to hexagonal heaven.\nThe king croons karaokilly, molar crowns abuzz,\nRetweeting to demotic headphone cowls.\nSome scale the cwms to flee the dead skunk, the gone coon scent;\nThe air cools quickly though. One cowers against a rock.\nMineral cubes and clews of fungal filament:\nThe cures are there. The cure to what?\nCows and camels root out the clues\nAs wrecking crews turn to the constitution\nIt\u2019s not that the opposition coos and preens,\nOr takes its cues from just any media moghul, but\nThe queues you see are for winter sales,\nFor a tropical cruise."}}
