{"poem": {"title": "Whistler, after Ingres, Roger Rescuing Angelica", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "'E nel passar vide, mirando a basso,\nAngelica legata al nudo sasso' (Orlando Furioso X 92)\nThe little pot tum, perhaps, though that bull neck, never...\nBut who, you say, and where, indeed, is Rodge?\nOld Roger, synonym Percy, anagram George,\nHis cheeks all pocked and checked, his engine poxed\nWho once was young, who had ponced a magic ring - \nHe's off screen, playing id and super ego\nLike, trouble with an outsize easel on a windy day,\nWith regard to this quivering trophy. The point is, I mean the point\nEmbodies and gets meaning from the plot:\nAngelica's here, Andromeda is not.\nAnd Ingres - forget Whistler - all that music,\nDid his wife play different women?\nDid the model see different men?\nPlopped her stays on the couch and said 'No chains,\nCher ma\u00eetre, we'll do this Gangnam style.\nThe dragon dazzled, she with such aplomb\nRomped off on Roger's pillion, he expecting prompt\nReward. As he propped and trussed his gear\nShe popped his magic ring and - pouffe! - \nHe never saw her again.\t\tTen years ago\nIn the artist's desk the daguerreotype was found\nOf a portrait, now lost, of his first wife,\nLong gone. The new wife would have blushed."}}
