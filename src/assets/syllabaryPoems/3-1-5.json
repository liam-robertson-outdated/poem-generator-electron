{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Three tanned and silver samurai\nWith their cutlery in golf bags\nVintage Harley saddle on the horse\nWe were off to the war.\nMe with just a big lance\nLooking to get maimed or amputated.\nAt his bus stop the sound technician left us\nWe were joined by one of my students\nNo backing out now, what though\nNot only had I nothing to prove\nBut there WAS nothing to prove\nProof being a factor of tautology\nSo more or less redundant. Banzai."}}
