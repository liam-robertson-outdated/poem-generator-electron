{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Wells is deep. He does cheap\nFiction wherein warts and wens\nDenote the wems and sins of\nThose he welds to\nWeds and pledges\nIn the wends and twists of\nPlotted webs strung tight.\nAh but the whelms and runnels of prosody\nHave to be cut for the stream and the slope.\nWhen's a good time? - I'nt it just.\nAnd where's a good place."}}
