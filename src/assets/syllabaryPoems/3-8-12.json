{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Papes and other blighters scoffing haddock or plaice and chips\nIt being Friday. There's aye one shouting the odds\nAnother mutters and prates full time, his pate's\nAway with it. The foreman plater plates and having\nHad his chips clocks in to wife and weans, the weeest\nBeing my dad. Somewhere in Renfrew. All gone.\nWho paints the woodwork? Does anyone lodge complaints\nAbout the bigots? I'd have thought not.\nThe plates I guess are delft; I mind\nThat word from way back. How did the place\nSmell? Hard work and prayer? Or reeking damp?\nPace yourselves, people: hard times ahead."}}
