{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "For what a body can't bear\nThere's signs like rhythm, gain on the amp,\nThe blizzard grain of fast film\nIn no available light;\nThere's other flesh, the ripped embrace\nOf sleekit lovers, leopards\nAnd those who would console a mother\nIn her grief."}}
