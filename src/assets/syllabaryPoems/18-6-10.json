{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It pushed out light, the sun did,\nNaked and near unwatchable\nRucked and hilled the covers and turned in bed.\nBy the slaughtering volume of its music hid\nFrom judgment, in an organ loft\nWhile I, on the granite flags,\nHymned its work."}}
