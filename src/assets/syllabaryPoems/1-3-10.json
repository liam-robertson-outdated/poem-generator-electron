{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey etc.", "text": "Good King Wenceslas looked out\nOn the feast of Steven\nWhen the snowly roundabout\nDeep and crisp and odd.\nAn odd and an odd is an even;\nAn odd and an even's an odd.\nParanoid his prosody\nNever checked his spelling.\nYonder peasant Squoo is he,\nSquare and squat his dwelling."}}
