{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The quays and keels, the creeds and creels.\nHe clears the deck and break- \nWater. Shipping forecast: that queers\nAnd thwarts an otherwise\nAcceptable pitch. The sea fog cleaves\nAs sea fog does. Its emblem? Rothesay\nItalian oyster ice-creams. Ach,\nThe owner cleans the display again.\nThe queen's booked in for fish tea. Well\nShe might, but for the herring gull that keens and splatters\nShe'd award him the keys to Dunoon."}}
