{"poem": {"title": "The Tortoise and the Hare", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The hare-brain dreamt it had been\nHaired, like brained, its hair banged out\nAnd - think \"Pandora's toothpaste\" - jugged, like\nJammed in a carapace when, hoached and hazed,\nIt hailed a cab that tottered up on bricks and chocks\nTo the finish line."}}
