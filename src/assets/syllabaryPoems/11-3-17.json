{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Whoever squawks is dead - two palindromes,\nTwo equilateral, sonic anagrams,\nOne hypothetical, one proleptic.\nLead type is movable, time is not. The clock\nIn little ice-age Bruges,\nImplacable stork - not that one with the snorkel\nIn the Bosch-pink body sock. Who put\nThe phlegm in Flemish, that I get:\nThe merchant taking stock; some yokel, his cotton\nSmock and dandy stalk of wheat.\nBut where did they get flamingoes, flimflam\nAnd flamenco dance\nTo stamp out the fire it started?"}}
