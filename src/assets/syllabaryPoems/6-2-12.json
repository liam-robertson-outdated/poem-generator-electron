{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Folks, I've become more mortal than I'd like.\nFirst it was milky sweat like my old dad,\nThen a putrid gust.\nWhat floats and keeps me\nIs cubes of reason. Just cast off\nAnd it's rot and sink, or sink and rot.\nAlthough,\nThere's a force of heart\nTo jigger habits,\nAn earthquake storm to rubble forts.\nAch, Swim a bit. 'Said and done\nYou're three-fourths salt and water."}}
