{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I take the law into my own hands\nBeauty touches and forgets\nRacing through women as you'd run across lily pads\n \nThe law is only old it is descriptive. Beauty\nDiscards it too. Young poets\nSo many old solicitors\nBang their pencilled fist on writing pads.\n \nIt wouldn't know it needed\nSexes and sentences\nCultural grime."}}
