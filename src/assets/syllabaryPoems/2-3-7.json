{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The school bell, if you muffled it,\nWould throb like a belted hand.\nNae tother a baa, nae bother at aa.\nPlier handles grip a tin of scotch broth\nThe opener gnaws around the rim.\nThat and a square of 3-D printed cheese,\nThe heel of a loaf. That and the Latin homework.\nYou and me, brother, both."}}
