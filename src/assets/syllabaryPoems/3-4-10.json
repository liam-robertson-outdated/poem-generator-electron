{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "When Pud was nine his dad died. Mid-term break, you know ?\nAnd Devlin calls him to the teachers' table,\nTalks to him, still eating, Pud stood there,\nGreitin as he come back, only time.\nNext he's got me in a finger lock\nGuiding me round the playground like reversing a toy ar-tick.\nThen when I pubbed in Kenya with the Irish\n(Old man minding the car was like a blanket around a stork)\nThat was the night a beautiful wee scrubber stood me a beer,\nGlowing from the bar as they explained (now she'll be deid)\nWell it turned out one of the Michaels\nCame across Pud in New York."}}
