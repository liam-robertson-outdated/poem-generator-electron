{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What was that in aid of? No one wins.\nWhirrs and clicks, steam bells and whistles. Someone\nWhirls it round his head and whizz: you don't need wings\nTo fly. But see for landing?\nThe whigs can claim biology and qualms\nOf conscience as progress. That's all.\nEvening brings the craws hame.\nJudges don their wigs.\nA will's read out, the heir cut off\nBy pre-demential whims.\nThe head-winds guide him."}}
