{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It could be simple as\nLog off in autumn,\nLopped and felled to winter in\nSome log ossuary, dry as bone.\nBut with the stump contriving spring,\nDoes the rood dream spook branches that spark like beaten nails?\nDo I really have to be led an endless shortcut by a child\nAnd the river of death to jump?"}}
