{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Pious hopes of poets\nCarved in glyphs on bars of\nSoap the polis issues every\nMonth or two, the doppler pulse, as we\nWhizz down the slope, backs up\nIts spoke to the hub,\nThe indecent keek-hole, the panopticon.\nYou poke at the gourmet grub, you\nCope with government hocus-pocus. A scope,\nIn all of this, is not a purpose."}}
