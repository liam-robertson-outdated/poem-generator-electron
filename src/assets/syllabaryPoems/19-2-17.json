{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You'd lent me your apartment\nI was looking out the window on New York\nAnd put my hands\nIn the pockets of your trenchcoat\nWhich I had no right to do, even if\nIt did look like my daughter's.\nI found a brown velvet clasp with a loop of ribbon\nYou fastened back your hair with that.\nThere was a singlet of yours on the floor.\nIn the other pocket\nWas a wrapper from an Opal Fruit. This WAS\nMy daughter's coat. What am I doing here?\nWisely then I woke up."}}
