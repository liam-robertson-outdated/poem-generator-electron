{"poem": {"title": "Bobo Jojo (\"un coup de d\u00e9s...\")", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "With taunts and rants he tops the bill\nAs a tuppeny toss engenders chance.\nThe talks break down and sex as well\nThe torse of that particular wave\nReduced to torques and moments.\nToffs are careless. Their accountants,\nLess so, calibrated\nAll the tots and jiggers, monogram troughs.\nNone of the time-warp Trots can catch them,\nTortfeasors all."}}
