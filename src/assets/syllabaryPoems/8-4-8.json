{"poem": {"title": "Alphabetical psalm (for Pietro Cardines)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Nun:\tThe yoke of his bones weighed down on him\nThe wife never sent a chaplain. The widow\nLeft him to the mortuary and the dead.\nOnly one relative\nSaw him lifted from the slab -\nIn parachute silk?\nFor the airforce had got wind of this\nAnd a guard of honour came.\nAnd no one wept in church, except\nOne officer, who couldn't stop.\nWhat got to him? What\nWas his name? The frailty\nOf the fighting man."}}
