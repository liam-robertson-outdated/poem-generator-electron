{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Looking to faze his fate\nThe singer feigns a feint,\nFails of course, though maybe the tune fares on.\nThe curvature of nothing\nIs just a phase, a rhetoric,\nCoin a phrase to plumb it:\nIt flares, it falls in dust and ice, a comet.\nBut even that elliptical vector frays,\nThe sun it frames, the Dantean flames of hell -\nThe singer flays them with the flails of grammar.\nIt's allarmingly Mallarmean."}}
