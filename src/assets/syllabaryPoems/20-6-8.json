{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "At the midnight crossroads Tam Lin turned\nTo a lion to a ling to a lintie. Still\nHis lover clutched him. Then he turned\nTo the lull when a sail would slack\nTo tonal drumming in the jungle night\nShe held him yet when he turned\nTo a Linwood Hillman Imp\nWell enough was enough."}}
