{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Vertebrae took shape from congealing soup\nFor which \"hot\" was blood-heat up,\nA one-horse town at high noon\nOn a horst in Arizona\nAnd love was hoist by its own petard\nTill rocks melt with the sun,\nTill the haunt of hell freeze over."}}
