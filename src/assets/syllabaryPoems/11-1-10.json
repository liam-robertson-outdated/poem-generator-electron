{"poem": {"title": "La Kiuva", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You'll have seen old faces scoured till they shone\nAs apple blossom soured into fruit, oh, every time\nI scowled at the tree that stood\nLike a pupil who would not get one verb wrong.\n\nNo friend of pain, I scowed the deep,\nDeep Field that Hubble plummeted ;\nIf every stound of neural lightning\nCoined another bright day out of me,\nWhat would the tannic darkness do ?\n\nWell, a self that gets too fearful can be sloughed ;\nI'm snake enough for that. Sound in the dark.\nThe message in the bottle is the wine."}}
