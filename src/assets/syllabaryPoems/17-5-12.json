{"poem": {"title": "A Self-Educated Working Man", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "One claps them in clay or casts in bronze\nThe calfs and bulls, the calves and bellies.\nCramps in the hand and cracks in stuff\nIt's a tough life, a good one.\n\nAnother clasps a scrag of - what? - existence?\nClamps it to him, cranks the ratchet till\nThis cracks and shears off.\nHe calques it to a noise, and that's its sense.\n\nA pack of those and he's the priest or bard\nThe cat's pyjamas. Camps on the holy mountain\nCaps the warrior with gold. His agent\nCarts off the silver. So the castes divvy up\n\nWhat paddies grew. The karsts gang dry\nAnd they forget to wreak, descry, defend.\nThe sense of class comes down to the crass\nEstate of connoisseurship."}}
