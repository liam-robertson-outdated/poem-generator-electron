{"poem": {"title": "Ulysses Didn't Play the Sax like Jackson Pollock", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Now the Iliad doesn't have him as an avant-garde performer,\nBut nor does it feature an equine installation,\nSo I'm wondering if the original said 'Ulysses was in the van'\nAs in vanguard, and somebody else thought  delivery van,\nNow what would the Trojans get delivered? Not Guinness or Milanda;\nMibbe horse meat? The French went in for that.\nAnd then somebody else said but they didn't have vans in antiquity;\nMaybe it wasn't horse meat: what if it was a horse?\nBut how could you hide Ulysses in a horse?', and on it went.\nYou see what I mean?"}}
