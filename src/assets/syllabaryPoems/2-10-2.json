{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What constitutes a bribe? Any gift with a shadow,\nAny service with a smile. If you want to bribe me\nDon't be subtle. Here's the list:\nThat desk lamp like the Stobcross Crane, on Boulevard Montparnasse,\n1600 francs. Dostoevsky's complete, 3000 francs;\nA 16th century Russian Anastasis, the size of a paperback,\nThat was 25,000 francs in 1985.\nA Borsalino panama hat, an old cinquecento;\nA covered swimming pool, duly maintained;\nThat job with airline tickets to romantic places;\nThe removal of those who offend me, bringing back the ones I miss;\nReincarnation as Genji, till I get bored;\nRebirth as the Buddha until everyone gets a life and there are no bribes."}}
