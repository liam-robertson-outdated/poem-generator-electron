{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "When you wade it slows you down, but if you let go,\nIt weighed and bore you up, it bore you out, refulgent,\nJustified in what you'd willed and waled.\nInvestors in the sabbath wailed anathema;\nYou smiled and waved, for God\nHad waived his right to kamikaze,\nAvenging wind. Not that his might, in any way, had waned\nOr dwindled."}}
