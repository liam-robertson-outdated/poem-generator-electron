{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The face in the snapshot tacked to the board was tracked down.\nThe hand behind the print on the thumb-tack tapped his phone and trapped him.\nTamped in a cell or cellar the monotony tramped him flat;\nHe was tasked with this and taxed with that but tact,\nAs in finesse, was not his thing:\nThe tract he'd hammered out they\u2019d hauled him in for?\nIt was tit-for-tat stuff any twat could do. Yet to deceive\nIs not a piece of tart or a meringue. He'd have had to practice.\nHe just got tanked and trashed the place."}}
