{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The buzzard mews the kite whinnies. One cow\nMoos another mows like reek\nThrough aa the week, and mouthes\nHer part on Sunday, o, or\nWhen the mood's on her, when it moves her to\nDance before the flat screen in her mules\nAnd mounds of old reminders\nThe moon's behind her, the TV flex\t\nMoors it to earth. She doesn't see\nThe muons but who does? Perhaps the muse\nOf physics."}}
