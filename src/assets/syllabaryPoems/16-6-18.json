{"poem": {"title": "Girl", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You skip this vowel and syllable\nAnd the word's mock-friendly cuddle.\nWith an alto growl and a Scotch snap\nYou're gone. I'm back\nTo pronouncing my own name\nThat some hear as McCaley\nAnd verbal algebra, in which\nThe gill of a shark becomes\nThe air-vent grill of a racing car."}}
