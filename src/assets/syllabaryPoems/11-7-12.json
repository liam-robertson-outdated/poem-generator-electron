{"poem": {"title": "Counsel to Foreign Poets", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If you want sex, better write in English\nAnd it has to make sense, but not too much.\nIf you're one of those serfs still ploughing regular verses\nIt's an EU farming subsidy you want. So - \nOption 1. Forget it. English poetry is a WOFT.\nOption 2 is septs and sects and celts and kilts and cults. They love it.\nOption 3. Now this one's only for well connected zeks:\nGet somebody to translate, footnote and print your every fart.\nOption 4. Encrypt. And then encrypt the key.\nConceal the stents and shunts, the technical specs.\nOption 5. For dollars cash and foreign scents, you get\nConstraints retailed as strengths\n(now there's a word, eight consonants, one vowel)\nsupple grammar and institutional lock-down\nthat generate immeasurable stress. Do not engage.\nPlay chases, type faces, make empty sets of noises\nA flight of steps going back the way it came."}}
