{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Lust will rob you of your innocence\nAge relieve you of your lust;\nDeath of course will then assuage\nOr abrogate old age. Sort of.\nFor innocence can outstare lust\nWhich can defer or ridicule age\nAnd though death does for age and lust\nIt can't touch innocence.\nCan't touch anything really:\nIts spurious personality looms\nIn the death of innocent creatures."}}
