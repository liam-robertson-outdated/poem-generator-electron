{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A wren on the branch above his head\nIn the mango orchard round an ancient stupa.\nThis is bliss! He tokes his pipe.\nHe didn't know the Indians had wrens.\nBut they didn't know that Cornishmen had sharks.\nRehearsing the honoured tropes with which it's done\nHe toasts absent friends. That takes a while.\nA servant totes the tiffin hamper back to barracks."}}
