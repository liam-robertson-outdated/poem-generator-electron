{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Your pal aped the panda\nThat eats shoots and leaves:\nHe ate, shat and left, belly-ached\nHe'd been aced and cleaned out.\nClean he ain't. So you see:\nWhen the little hand gets to eight\n(That's west south-west) we don't want grief.\nYou'd best be gone."}}
