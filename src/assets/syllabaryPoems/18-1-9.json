{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Silvershod hoofed it. Not hooked, for a spell,\nTo the sexual verbs have and be,\nI went on a spending spree: books.\nYes I know they're hiding the carpet\nBut who gives a tarnished hoot? The moonatic's\nHooped with a nicotine rainbow.\nBuy me this coin - Athena's Owl,\nA silver bullet champed at the bit.\nSlip it under my tongue when I leave you."}}
