{"poem": {"title": "Enjoy Your Meal", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Boys in the morning\nPluck fish from the reef:\nThe puzzling crow\nScoops at itself in the only glass\nWindow. I read and I cook\nAnd I read. Biarritz, '41:\nA cocktail reception so\nBrilliant, who needed the view?\nAnd who was that flyting with\nGood Walter Benjamin? Who\nCould outshine Django Reinhardt?\nTo the host I said tell me, how many survive?\nHe smiled and he said two or three. Head down,\nKneel down on that carpet and scream\nTo wake here, in Bata'an. What connection?\nSame surf, the same transient swallows;\nPerhaps the same quiet American found himself\nHere one year on, being marched to his death by the Japs.\nAnd I saw Biarritz as a child, when American\nBombers were using Bata'an to undo Indochina.\nNo need for ordnance now, the planes are enough.\nJust two degrees more and you're gone from the reef to the road."}}
