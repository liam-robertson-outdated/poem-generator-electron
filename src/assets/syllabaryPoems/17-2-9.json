{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Flung off his coat, the stoker\nAnd his tender all coked up\nAlong the coast the driver coaxed it\nOwre Drumochter Pass. To the picture-house\nWe coursed in blackout/white-out 1941:\nIt's murder polis going to Inverness.\nDon't court Ms Astor, Humphrey! She's the one\nYour partner crossed. He croaked in the opening shot.\nDon't answer every time it rings. To quote Karl Marx,\nThe real block-buster is its own McGuffin.\nThen again, you coped; you cloaked and swaggered off\nNot to the White House but to Casablanca.\nHer purse with the hammered colt was handed on.\nYou coached the boss for a part in Chinatown."}}
