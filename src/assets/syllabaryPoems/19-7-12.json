{"poem": {"title": "In a Crowded Lift", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Warm and damp, the leather welts\nThe weather wets her corky hair\nWents are missing roads I took\nWefts flash across them.\n\nWhence? I don't know.\nWhat for? Not for\nMeeting needs and making more.\nWhere to? Oot\nForever. Hence the pencil."}}
