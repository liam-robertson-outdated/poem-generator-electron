{"poem": {"title": "Gutted", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It comes and goes, that kingdom, its ambassadors\nDon and discard us for a year, a day,\nOr not. You see it now, you gawp dead-eyed and now you don't\nYou don't know, steel counter, scaly ice and flesh,\nIdentity paraded silent sing-along."}}
