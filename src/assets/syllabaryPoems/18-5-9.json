{"poem": {"title": "for Sandy Hutchison", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "We're hatched or smothered, hushed or\nHashed out / corrected / right ourselves\nFor a bit. Unlike\nHis holy angels in Govan.\n'What hast, what dost?'\n'No rush to dust, thank you, you fucking factoid.'\n'Time you hasped that lip, sirrah.'\n'Past time you happed that chiffon thing and fell aff.\nTime was Tin Dining Street on high was where\nYou harped, except on the crib.'\n'The heart has its reasons reason\nDoesn't know - the hurt has too.'\n'Maybe, but it beats me. I've harked\n(Or hearkened). No one spoke;\nI've hacked your system: nothing there\nWorth keeping under my hat.'"}}
