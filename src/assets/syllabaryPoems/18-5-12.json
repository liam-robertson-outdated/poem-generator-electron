{"poem": {"title": "Scotland Again", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Donkeys wear straw hats. Deer don't\nTill taxidermy, when they sprout,\nBy flickering hearths in lodges\nWith their hearts gone to the dogs,\nToo many items of harris headgear. Be a burro!\nthe  gillie hacks two holes in your sombrero. Castanet\nSparks of static jump between your lugs in halfs and starts\nTo drown the signal rhetoric of fairy harps, that antlers\nReceived as surely as its hasps\nClutch a family bible."}}
