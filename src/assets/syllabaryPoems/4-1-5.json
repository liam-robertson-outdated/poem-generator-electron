{"poem": {"title": "Gerard Street", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She is glazing duck in a noisy restaurant\nWhen a poem learned in childhood sheds her tears in the sink.\nShe remembers it with one word wrong.\nThe poet, by the time he wrote it,\nHadn't been moved by that or anything else in twenty years."}}
