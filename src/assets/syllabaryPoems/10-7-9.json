{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "My debt is the life I have left, and I'm paying ;\nI've been dealt a fine hand I can barely hold to my chest.\nOh, if I could put a dent in this wall of law, now that would be something,\nBut duty and debt accrue. Forget forgiveness\nDeft as the hands of a servant when she tucks in linen.\nDressed in ancient clothing, decked in pearls stronger than the law\nShe dreamt on sleeping waters and the dream\nForgave\nForgetfulness."}}
