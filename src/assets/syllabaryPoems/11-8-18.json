{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A skail wind shoogles sail to lace.\nWeatherman sees its snail make landfall\nIts stripe of swale on dust\nThe wood it shreds to spale and splinter \u2013 \nA fire sale of sorts, of stale and smoke;\nNo customers, but violent economies of scale."}}
