{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Give them their due: they were crass\nBut they'd chew up and spit out their foe by the gross\nAnd keep order: a Jew to the lions, a Gaul to the cross.\nAsleep on their watch, what tin tortoise-shells\nTin and lead: bronze, body armour. Dew on the grass."}}
