{"poem": {"title": "Mission Control", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Amice, alb and girdle, stole and chasuble\nThe priest got togged up like an astronaut\nTo blast off in a cloud of incense\nOrbit the altar two-and-a-half times\nDo some moonwalk maintenance on the tabernacle nose-cone\nThen back to the chapel house\nFor Sunday lunch."}}
