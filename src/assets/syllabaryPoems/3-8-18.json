{"poem": {"title": "Class Consciousness", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The history teacher\nAsking round the class\nWhere we're going our holidays:\nWith bucket and spade,\nWith pail and shovel\nTo the beach at Rothesay\nWarded by Polaris\nSubmarines. Watching\nThe investiture\nOf the peely-wally\nPrince of Wales.\nMe reading War and Peace."}}
