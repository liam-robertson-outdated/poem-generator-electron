{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Where wing meets flap it's written\nIn English and Chinese DO NOT WALK\nOUTSIDE THIS AREA. Since it's six miles over Moscow\nMoving at preternatural speed, that could go without saying.\nAnd why does it say Air China in big letters? For the spy sats?\nWhy are the meals so bad and the drink so stingy?\nMeals - now there's a word you don't see in\nPoems. You might wonder what it means."}}
