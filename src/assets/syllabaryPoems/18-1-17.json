{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Stuck at this one. Howk it out\nThe ball from the ruck,\nSpud from sod, stone from tread\nShard of root from gum\nAnd then what?\nThe hook:\nA left to the jaw and a barb in the right\nNostril, poorly cast, the catch line\nCaught, but, and you can't\nGet it out of your head."}}
