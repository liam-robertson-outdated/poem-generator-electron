{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Gravity's the barb that gaffs us to this sticky wullie.\nLife would be the valve that shoves us into it.\nBarb on a line, valve on a surface; what\nIn a volume flypes us into place? Maybe nothing,\nMaybe kisses, maybe dreams.\nWhy, my twin-in-law, when we found a moment to embrace\nLike adolescents at a family gathering,\nDid my incisors braille my spouse's ear lobes?\nWhat was the point of hiding, what the source\nOf grieving, in the wings of 9 to 5?\nTwo figures on a classical bas relief\nWhere a detail shows that one is dead. In another life\nThe dream is not a frontier post\nWhere old ideas are banished and old emotions come home."}}
