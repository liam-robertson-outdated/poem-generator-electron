{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Don't start.\nNo as smart as he looks, and he doesn't\nWhat? A wee bit saft I'd say.\nA slat in the venetian blind a-\nSlant there's scant sunlight\nThrough pigeon scat and what gets spat\nOn glass by Joe Bloggs, Jack Spratt, whoever.\nWhatever.\nYou spanked the boss?\nNot mine; they'd sacked me.\n\u2026 it all stacked up.\nYou smacked a managerial bot.\nI snacked at my desk, I never slacked.\nYou slashed a canvas in the guest room\nYou splashed the guest room rest room. You got smashed\nOn snifters stashed for visitors.\nYou snatched a few for later, scratched\nA maledictory message on the panelling\nAnd left. Hatted and scarfed you left, but the gate\nWas staffed by a zero-hour gorilla \nWho'd sapped my will to live.\nYou snapped his wrist; you slapped another one?\nNot as if I'd scalped um. Self defence.\nNo win, no fee? The whole system scrapped.\nManagement strapped down and de-\nLobotomized. Prescription stamped.\nThe patient sat there."}}
