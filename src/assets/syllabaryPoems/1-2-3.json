{"poem": {"title": "\"And winking mary buds begin\"", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If, at primary school, you were made to sing \"Hark, hark, the lark\"\nAnd taught that its author was \"maybe the greatest bard that ever lived\"\nBut haven't yet gone off the way of the words,\nThen either there was a lot of weight on \"maybe\",\nOr you reckoned you could dunt him off his plinth,\nOr maybe, friend, you know when to listen to the singer\nAnd when to the song."}}
