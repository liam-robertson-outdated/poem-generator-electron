{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The ass, to the thistle, is ax and pestle.\nBristle its arse. Great arcs of piss. So much\nFor Scotland's sign on upturned arks, the apse\nOf kirks, the printer's arts on acts of parliament.\nIt's THERE as literal ants in a hexameter\nAre not, nor the rhythm of rock songs in plywood amps;\nUp there in mythic force with the Alps, with the asps\nOf Asculapius, here it's \u2013 rendered down to veggie gristle.\nYet Cleopatra asks and they prepare for her\nA bath of ass's milk."}}
