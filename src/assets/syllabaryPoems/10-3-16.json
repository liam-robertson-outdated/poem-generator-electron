{"poem": {"title": "Dog /Gyp", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Tongue tripping him\nBarking his brains loose\nCrotch-otrope\nScared silly by the aliens in his nose\nStuck between pursuit and usufruct (he won't\nGive up the ball), anxious as a linesman, yet,\nOut walking, seized of a stick, happiness is.\nOurs was never house-trained\nNor bit back at kicks or yanks on the leash.\nSister got it, mum looked after it,\nDad had it put down. No way\nTo treat a guest. No way to be."}}
