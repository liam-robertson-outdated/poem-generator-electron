{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Was it Jack or the knocker\nThat knocked on the door?\nDid the noise or the knocker disturb?\n(It said don't). Did the knot in her handkerchief\nSlip? Or did Jill not\nRemember to what naught?\nThe bedpost was multiply knotched\nBy that knife on the floor."}}
