{"poem": {"title": "Belvedere", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Lob\nThe sun high\nAnd a narrow arch\nBeyond which\nAs in a pond\nShe watches\nApollo Belvedere\nHis bow and laurel sprig.\n\nA face glimpsed in a crowd\nCan get Bernini'd in me,\nFigured like Chipangu\nBy cartographers to the pope.\n\nClear brow, and from the bridge\nA steep, narrow ridge down\nTo two commas.\nStraight, retentive mouth and eyes.\n\nThere\nIs a face\nThat may become\nA map on vellum and bone\nOf forgotten countries."}}
