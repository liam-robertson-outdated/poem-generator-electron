{"poem": {"title": "Judo", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "'Whose side', she sighed, 'Would you be on ?\nAnd smiled. 'The perpetrator\nNever signed his snide remark\nOn the woman it was sired on. See ?'\nShe showed her hand. 'Your name\nIs not there.' - 'Who would put\nHis hand to an unsized canvas ?\nSlide-thrift. Your move.'\n\nA man she should have taken in her stride,\nA self-styled master, scythed her self-\nEsteem in this po-faced\nPyjama tango."}}
