{"poem": {"title": "Prison Camp at Prony; Whales beyond the Reef", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A mind at odds with its body clock\nDrove a bow wave through fords\nJuddered on laterite to where reef\nAnd mangrove grate the ocean,\nDish it up in prison soup. Can't slip the net.\nNo ship to unlock a gate to the tallow\nArchipelago, the cool school of depth and distance.\nJust a crabwise gait in the rocks,\nThe crab's interrogation: Are you so great?\nI am. So good? No.  What good greatness?\nDo you love? I've known love. Not the question;\nIf you don't love, then say, and leave. All morning,\nFrom the shed where men hauled wood\nTo the mine where iron held them, haunted.\nHatred has no right to rule on love,\nI saw at last: this wasn't about me. Look:\nHere is where the enemies of empire\nDied. The banyan strangling that gaol\nIs rooted in their bones. Injustice\nStops the dead from sleeping. May they rest."}}
