{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Its creed is a church's nave, stone keeled or wooden,\nQueered and thwarted.\nA source code keyed in to the mother board\nWhere this little routine cleared it with the government,\nThat one creamed off cash,\nAnd this little bot took all the little secrets,\nAll the little secrets it cleaned and screened and stashed."}}
