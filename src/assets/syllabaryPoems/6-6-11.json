{"poem": {"title": "Deep Harbour (Djupviken)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A spray of figs on shore, she fills\nHer strips of cotton sail (no frigs, no frills)\nAnd beams at this, my face like fizz.\nShin-deep in shingle frizz, she flings\nA stick. The hounds of the gale dive in,\nWith canine fids to try the knots of\nCold or courage in me:\nHonoured fibs and firms dissolve\nIn flimsy bubbles. Hope, like her\nAnd Finland, grows on granite."}}
