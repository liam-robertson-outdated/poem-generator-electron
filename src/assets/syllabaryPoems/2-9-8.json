{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Gerry Magennis shared a room with Viktor.\nViktor lounged in bed all day smoking and saying Blyad.\nA whirlwind known as Viktor's Buryat Girlfriend\nSaw to the rest. Gerry's girlfriend Sendy\nLooked a bit too much like Garbo for anybody's good.\nTo him the rouble was the Panamanian Gumbean;\nThe Finns who puked in Leningrad hotels -\n'They're making it up', he said. 'They're making WHAT up?'\n'that language: it doesn't exist'. Viktor! Gerry\nMagennis! Leningrad! Better a brilliant has-been\nThan a never was."}}
