{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Where's my kag? No answer. My cagool?\nThe neighbours think of anarchist hoods and picture a balaclava.\nSay that, though, and they might hear baclava? or bacal\u00e0, and wonder\nWhat I want with a cake exuding sugar, or a fish that's stiff with salt.\nAh, but the freight of simple words like crag,\nOr cargo, come to that: Wells Fargo on TV, Stagecoach and\nIn a tenement bath that polythene cargo boat\nWhose motherly hold took all my enamelled cars and never sank,\nWhen cars and cargo boats were shearing off the glacier Glasgow."}}
