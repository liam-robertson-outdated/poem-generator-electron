{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Deirdre,\nWe got your postcard. Only you\nWould send us a daguerreotype of San Zeno\nFrom NYC. It's raining here. It rains,\nIt does rain. Here, just like in Glasgow (Scotland),\nVerona and New York. That's neither here\nNor there. It isn't raining in the postcard,\nNor on it, where magenta clouds are held\nAt bay as the Romanesque confabulation\nExplains itself in yellowing black on white,\nSo there's no drop nor damp to fox the coloured\nOil Mantegna cut when he intoned\nThe 4-dimensional triptych on the alter.\n4-PART MOTET REFASHIONS TIME AND SPACE\nwas the headline in La Suisse that day. Today:\nORGANES HUMAINS: UN MONSTRUEUX TRAFIC\nNOS PAGES OFFRES D'EMPLOI. I should apply:\nA dealer in hearts, a vendor of spleen more often.\nEnough of that. The Gaberlunzie Man\n- allow the lateral jump, I'll get to the point - \nwas James V touring Edinburgh incognito;\nI fancy that in Scotland every day\nThere's a 5'72 space the rain runs rings round\nBut doesn't touch, the burl and build of me;\nIt's stencilled next to a tenement,\nAt a closemouth looking in, or on a roof,\nExtended on the sphagnum, combing the machair\nWith all the other exiled presences,\nGod's gaberlunzies. Got the picture? Right,\nSo far so long, Manhattan Harmattan."}}
