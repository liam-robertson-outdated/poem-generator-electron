{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The aide is loyal to his boss\nNot to the company or to herself:\nExpendable, they are, as words to lullabies, there, there.\nThe boss aimed high and fell flat. What ailed him\nWas grievous colic waiting to be aired.\nLanguage came to his aid, a con-\nSolation in the guise of an account."}}
