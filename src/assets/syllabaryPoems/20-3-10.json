{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Poor swan: cold eggs and a flotsam nest\nIt lolled to build again, too close\nTo the reservoir. The razor wire\nWas sung through by the wind, that tore\nThe tear gas from protesters who were taking a quiet burger\nJoint. Complaints were lodged on reinforced\nConcrete bricks and lobbed at folk brought there\nFor that, who hadn't logged the far rainforest;\nThey longed, it's true, to kiss their teak\nNight sticks goodbye, live off the land\nAnd pension funds dependent on flotation\nOf jetsam from the Yanomani nation.\nIt doesn't matter, laud the lord above:\nthe Heads of State sing All you Need is Love."}}
