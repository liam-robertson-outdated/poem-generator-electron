{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I saw a snow leopard once.\nIn Basel Zoo.\nHadn't thought they were real.\nIt, being four days old, was just a joy.\nNow down to pards and ounces in the margin\nUnless ... Unless? What kind of word is that?\nShouldn't it mean more? Or nevertheless?\nOr a Beckett bedroom farce? He palms a number\nPads along the hall. A keyhole watches her unless\nParse that! But what? Pramfuls of props. Correction:\nPramsful. Two old pals swap pangs in the back.\nUnsanctioned, unaccounted for,\nThe dead, I'm thinking, might have had their plans,\nTheir secret hopes. But what pans out."}}
