{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "No sooner had the tempest digested them\nThan Prospero stopped and said\n(To the rainbow, through a spider web)\nMiranda! Here's Caliban crushed in a book\nAnd Ariel, quick as click, but caught\nIn the self silver of a mirror server.\nMyself is elf and serf, and I, the other,\nHere conjure\t\tRough magic."}}
