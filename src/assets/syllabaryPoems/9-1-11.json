{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Are towels tools? Trowels are.\nTowers of Silence, projectors of the dead,\nCould be, but tombs are not. Ming tombs,\nSo Moscow Subway-like, all porphyry and marble\nGoing nowhere in a circle, ax- and de-\nCelerators of the masses in twos and threes,\nWith above-ground tours for towns on the periphery."}}
