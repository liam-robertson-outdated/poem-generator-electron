{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Off piste on an active cone\nThat had pierced the bio\nAnd peaked at 2-3 thousand\nAs dawn peeped the rim.\nUp through a peat hag,\nSoggy archive that will pleat and fold away\nBut can't retrieve, much less, by\nPeeking at the answers, understand\nIts ancient forest; some bog-Latin monk\nFiling jerky strips of Aeschylus neither\nHe nor his order could or would have pieced together."}}
