{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Face it: you are not wanted.\nThe gang turns away, you go home on your own\nThey don't even bother to thump you.\nThe friends then were fakes - or did they intercede?\nWhat dandruff flakes of comfort.\nAche of the empty freights and rusty grasses. It is mine\nGrandest gift of the fates."}}
