{"poem": {"title": "High Table", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Desks grumble. Class rises for the guest.\nIn Soviet car plants\nWhere dearths were factored in\nTo personal debts\nSteel was siphoned into skillets\nClutchplates came out as dense\nAs osteoporotic delft:\nHe decks the pedal and the brake surprise surprise\nDents in the bumper - a brace of roadkill.\nDeaths for dinner, darling, one ought to dress."}}
