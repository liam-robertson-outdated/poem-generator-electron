{"poem": {"title": "Freedom Fries", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He played cricket, my dad. You can whack\nFours and sixes, but fives are a slog,\nWhat with fires invading the pitch.\nAnd then poems are on-the-spot fines;\nThey take time - and for what? Wee phials\nOr files of sound, sense and shape:\nNothing for staingramdotcom,\nNothing that finds a solution. The smoke?\nIt chases the flies from your double\nBeefburger and chips."}}
