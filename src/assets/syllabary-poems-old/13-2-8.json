{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "In line with my wife\nA hen-toed Korean\nNot twenty: licorice\nCable of hair at her nape\nDown on her temples\nNo profile. Not quite. A short\nUpper lip. Shy\nTits on a stele from the Cyclades\nBroad and thin shoulders like wings. A low voice\nResounding in what? How has she felt\nAmong big Western blondes? Shown\nTheir passport, both of them gone\nOn the same plane to Asia."}}
