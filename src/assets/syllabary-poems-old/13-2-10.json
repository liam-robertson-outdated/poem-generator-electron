{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "You dreamt of a seal\nOn a crocodile's back\nQuite happy, swimming\nDown the river.\nWhat did they have\nIn common? - Both\nAmphibians. It\nShowed the old ideal\nAs a dream shored up\nWith a shoulder to cry on.\nA seal on a  crocodile's back\nIs a wife that relies on a husband."}}
