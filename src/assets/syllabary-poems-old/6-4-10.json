{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A two-pin jolt of fear can cure\nUncertainty and doubt, enlight\nDecisions you had fudged or\nStomp-box fuzzed to wow fund managers.\nBut when the adrenaline flood\nHas you all but levitate by the scrotum\nIn that pompom-furred scut\nMy flop-eared friend\nYour wet nose doing its Lady Macbeth\nI can't help but think polenta."}}
