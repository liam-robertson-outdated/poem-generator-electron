{"poem": {"title": "Which Is Not How It Works", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She backs up, hits Send and blacks out,\nBanks on the redacted blanks\nProtecting her from blasts out of the blue.\nThe bass, or sea-wolf, hunts in shoals\nThat fishermen track like bats.\nThey don't land the little brats with baited brass.\nThink how chitinous bracts cradle the bud.\nA chainsaw barks in the wood."}}
