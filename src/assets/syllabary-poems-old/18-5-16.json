{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I'm a hag-ridden nag - or could I be the nightmare itself?\nLet's say the former: get up every evening to race,\nMore quarantine gurney than horse,\nnegotiate damaged goods the receding\nSystem's put my way but don't win clear\nTo the dappled charge, to career across the land bridge.\nOtherwise, a bureaucrat\nTo test your wit and tax your strength. So\nGo and have a swim, it'll do you good.\nThere's three old ladies peching to stay afloat\nAnd a woman in her 20s whose husband will be at work.\nGo on. Wake up."}}
