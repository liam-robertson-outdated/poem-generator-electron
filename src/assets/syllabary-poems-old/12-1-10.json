{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Two days at the kitchen table with Ushakov\n(Moscow, 1938), 4 vols, dark,\nDark green cloth cover, I chewed\nAt Pasternak (\"Parsnip\")'s early books of verse.\nRussian-English: brazier, brocade,\nGirt, adze, muzzles, sleepers, oven door, vitriol,\nBiscuit barrel, eagle owl, door curtain, abscess,\nSalt pans, Tatar tax collector, runrigs, ingot,\nMisfire, mapping pen, Adam's apple, alder,\nWeighman, buffalo, farthingale, meltwater,\nCatkin, fibril, crossbill, stilts, zinc white,\nFirebox, systole, crossbow - straight syntax,\nStrong, simple beat of a young heart, constant\nFretting about the weather. Pagan\nPilgrimage for me, who dug the lexical landscape\nMore than the shiny CIA facsimile\nOf the legendary 60s Soviet edition. Still,\nThe smart thing to do back then\nWith your Dylan Albert Hall concert bootleg\nWas swap it for this and learn some Russian."}}
