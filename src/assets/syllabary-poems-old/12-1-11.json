{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Jewels and jowls: the opera crowd.\nThe king of the jews takes a bow. The people choose\nRed. Glass. A good blast of Wagner\nTunes up the boxes and tubes. No it doesn't.\nA hack in the Interval Bar chews his burgundy.\nJune's a good month in Bordeaux, see,\nFor surfing on sand dunes and checking out plonk.\nNo it's not. The duet's a duel: both want\nThe soprano. The deal is the tenor\nGets her on stage; the bass gets her off. Yes he does."}}
