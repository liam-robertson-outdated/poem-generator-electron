{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Words - a wad of tens for tramps\nInflation tends to sully.\nThe joker treads a line between\nTwo towers on a bar chart made of trends\nIn sub-prime loans for real estate that was.\n\nTerns bob around him, spears trained on runkled water\nThe architectural paradigm comes to terms with -\nWhich tells us something about endeavour in the abstract,\nWhere twelves, for instance, is a word, and twelve a number."}}
