{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Fair's fair or fair enough:\nYou flag a taxi, you pay the fare.\nIf the driver's bad, call a skinner\nTo peel him alive from the flair of his nostrils\nTo the curl of his toes. Some poets drool on that\nVellum, ready-printed in reverse\nAnd the blow-up doll they can send off\nOn a methane flare."}}
