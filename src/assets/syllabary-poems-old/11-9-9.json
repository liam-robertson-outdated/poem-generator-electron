{"poem": {"title": "The Sound of Sleat", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Zen tinnitus. The sail was steeped in\nSoggy snow, white noise\nSeeped into the rations,\nThe sweet rationale of pleasure boats\nThat snuck in the wrong side of bed with the wind\nTo get turfed out the other; back in, so on.\nShort wave splutter and screeched,\nFibres quaked and squeaked.\nIt was all so much\nLike drawing a bow from a seat on the arrow\nWe shot through the water, far from the roads\nOn grey street."}}
