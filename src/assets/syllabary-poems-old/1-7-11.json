{"poem": {"title": "Pisan Cantos, Voronezh Notebooks", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Old Ez folds his blankets\nThe hoarfrost ebbs to a vision\nA mirage of eggs for breakfast\nAs he errs in the Great Saharan Ergs of\nThat cantankerosity that\nNothing in him has the strength to break.\nThe earls of language, dear sir,\nAre aye in debt: to usury, I grant; if not -\nTo work that earns and doesn't buy\nThis ens reale, the ends of art,\nWith O.M.'s poems seven years stopped,\nToo cold for elm's or almond's root,\nToo hard for elves or angels\nTwo ells in a communal slot.\nThe light of Glasgow I regret\nAnd will regret the more, or would\nIf, dead, the dead regret, repine\nError all in the not done,\nAll in the diffidence that faltered."}}
