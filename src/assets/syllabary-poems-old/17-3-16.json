The first manned flight\nWas feather-fledged, and flapped.\nMachines don't need that skeuomorphic stuff.\nRecycle tyre-treads as flip-flops \u2013 \nNo skin off their nose. Baptize yourself\nA cog in the wealth condenser \u2013 \nLanguage too is otiose. Sabotage\nSabotage, though, they find that problematic."}}
