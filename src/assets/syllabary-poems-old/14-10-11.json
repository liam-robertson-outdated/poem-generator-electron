{"poem": {"title": "Life", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What writhes on the slide is still. The world\nSimmers round it. Though it rives and rhymes itself, it's still\nOne utterance, the rinds of little cells incorporated\nNot discarded. The vehicle it rides is sheer inertia,\nTamil bronze. It riles the planets - not so as they'd\nRise up. Or notice."}}
