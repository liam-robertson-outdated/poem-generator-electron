{"poem": {"title": "Radio Caroline", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The crew I can imagine: fresh and hopeful\nAs the queue of singles waiting to be spun.\nBut as to how a record deck could work on the North Sea swell\nI have no clue. Did they have\nA billiard table too, in the mess? the balls adrift\nLike spirit-level bubbles, space invaders,\nThe cue - a lumbering, predigital cursor?\nAnd a cow called Caroline on deck\nTo grow grass in the cowpats."}}
