{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Bleach is whiten or black,\nBotch is wreck or repair.\nBroaches breach or bedeck;\nThey can make a barque wallow \u2013\nNot birch bark. Some beechmast, maybe,\nIn a hot bright purple borsch,\nMe the butcher adding this batch of words,\nBatch as in 'bacio', a kiss; it's from baking and brewing.\nAnd a blotch of smetana on top."}}
