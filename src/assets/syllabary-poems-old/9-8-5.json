{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Nicola's great run of dreams, when she\nWas pregnant and couldn't find a flat:\nThere, in a draughty firestation, thinking\nCurtains on the skylight, a kitchen range;\nOr in an empty multistorey carpark:\nA cot for the baby there, the bookcase by that ramp,\nIt could be nice. Where would it all have ended?\nA trave for shoeing horses, God help us, a burned-out mall.\nQueue three days in the rain outside a camp."}}
