{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Quick water slid on the flush-silled strid\nAnd spilled. The meadow swigged and swilled it\nFat to muscle slimmed and strained athwart\nAs two skilled oarsmen skimmed from quick\nTo salt to see-saw something\nDevil-deep skirled ink and squirmed\nA squid! A squid! My kingdom for\nBut bless me father I have skinned\nA cat. No bless me I have fathered\nKids skid skid and even they\n'll have sinned."}}
