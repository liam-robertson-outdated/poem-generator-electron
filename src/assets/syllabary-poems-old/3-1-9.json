{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Four winds pout from the corners\nA paper craft, stiff pounced and crimped\nIts name picked out and proofed in squid ink\nThe mate pushed off and put to sea.\nNot broached but fairly pooped\nThe drunken captain puked.\nThis doesn't end well."}}
