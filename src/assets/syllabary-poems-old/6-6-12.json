{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I'll fix you captions to imagined flicks,\nSupply the flints and tinder for a lantern\nTo launch a shimmering skiff in your picture house,\nFits and starts of sense that flits\nA little beyond your reach. It flirts with you.\nBe a bit less stiff,\nStop making pocketfuls of fists\nIn that raincoat no one frisks\n(The filth has other stuff in mind:\nIn fifths and syncopation the chase-scene flips,\nHe gets away. The feds get just the spilth.)"}}
