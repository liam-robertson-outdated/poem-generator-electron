{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She loved a good wake. It was\nThe tea and sandwiches, solemnity,\nSolempnity. The watchfulness of Mary\nStar of the Sea in the wake of the dead\nA keel-shaped flame\nSlim as double sculls, the eyes of the beast\nThat's my cat Jeoffrey. Loves a good sandwich."}}
