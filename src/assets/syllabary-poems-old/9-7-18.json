{"poem": {"title": "Sunday Morning Tea in Baghdad", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The fate of Lebanon hung by a thread\nAnd that thread was the life of Hafez al Assad.\nLast time he went to tell his vote\nHe was lifted shoulder-high through the crowd\nAnd the television saw him weep. Assad,\nWho knew the name of every officer in his army!\nHad he forgotten everyone within range was in his pay?\nBelieve your own lies and you won't see it coming."}}
