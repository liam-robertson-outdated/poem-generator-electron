{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Eggs are grails - kenspeckle, real,\nWith miracle yokes and glairs.\nThe games we play, the clever films we make\nCan't measure up, for all Mifune glares\nIn his samurai kit. Carmichael's\nSongs of the Gaels in grains of gold -\nJust market gains in augrim winter gales.\nOur grades are close to zilch, our colours\nBeige and greys. The greys are good.\nWild sheep may safely graze\nOn pastoral graves, whose brindled glades\nCan welcome glums and gays.\nApply the verbal glaze, un-say it.\nGaze till you maybe see."}}
