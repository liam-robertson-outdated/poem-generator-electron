{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Old saws and new songs\nToothless smogs chew tasteless bridges\nCloudy swabs\nExpunge entitled snobs and sundry slobs\nAs a housemaid's hoover snogs fitted carpets\nIn cheap hotels she slogs at it\nFruit scones, she's thinking\nStorms in teacups. Perhaps\nYon angel sobs perhaps\nNot at particular old squaws but\nOver the wondrous rigour of sod's law in the lower orders\nAnd swans off. Swarms of such messengers\nAttend the golden hive. Squads of dominations\nSqualls of them, by and large unfazed\nBy mortal static from below. The engine stalls\nWe drift. Straws\nOn swelling scrawls of this flood\nSilts and sails\nThat sprawls in its unmade bed\nAnd spawns a million bright green spears of rice to port and thwart.\nShoots and swords, spoils and defence in one\nFisherfolk live in frail with spalls of noise I wield as words for them, not more.\nA conscript on his bicycle with camouflage umbrella\nAnd regulation gun.\nThe skipper solves his obstinate conundrum and we're off\nA monk in the bow rearranges his maroon, a second's spinnaker."}}
