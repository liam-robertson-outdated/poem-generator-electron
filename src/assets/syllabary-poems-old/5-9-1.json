{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I've known these twenty years when I was beat.\nI've learned to see this woodland make\nA scrapyard of the lower visible spectrum,\nA raptor without a wingbeat cross a quarter of the sky,\nA thread of what must be gossamer in the blue\nGo over the trees in the slovenly, trailing V of migrant birds;\nHere and again I have my say."}}
