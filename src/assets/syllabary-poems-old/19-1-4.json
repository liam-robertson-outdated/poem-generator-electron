{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ten years ago to the night, we came\nOn a one-way  ticket and a two-year contract,\nWith a little girl, a little cash and a Christmas crib.\nDoes the woman through the wall from that\nFirst, furnished flat still cry all night?\nDoes the transvestite who beat his dog\nHave regular fistfights with the neighbour?\nWill his pal still call the police? My embourgeoisement\nComplete, I've no nostalgia for the womb,\nBut I think it's time we left the incubator."}}
