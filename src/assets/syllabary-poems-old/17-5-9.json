{"poem": {"title": "for Sandy Hutchison", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I'd have clamped my teeth tighter than it's cramped in there,\nArms clasped and coopered, though it's ME that's casked\nSome Thing. Maybe. Drouth like a summer karst, I cranked out\nJokes. Crashed on the way home. Write-off. Not a cut or scratch.\nI had nine lives therefore I was a cat.\nCamped out on the fell, crapped out of the climb I'd planned.\nBack to my clapped-out blank.\nThis is a sturdy craft, I say, not some cart-\nLoad of meretricious Murakami. More it is\nThan it's cracked. Clashed with the fitba. So?\nTo have been capped, not cursed or carped at, out-\nClassed by the players, out-quaffed by the fans, cast\nOut as in cacked by the body politic.\nCashed in my chips and re-invested."}}
