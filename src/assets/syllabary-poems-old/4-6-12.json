{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Buy your Bombay mix with rupees\nFrom the Mumbai mint.\nBeware of those moustachioed\nGreek demigods from Gandahar,\nBut script their myths of solitude\nFor Bollywood. Don't miss a trick, so\nLittle Miss Minx can mince in her minks\nA Bangalore rhythm in workaday pinks,\nRings on her mitts, polo mints on her toes,\nSteak mince and tatties wherever she goes."}}
