{"poem": {"title": "South-Facing Stele", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The raven took instruction for a thousand years\nFrom Brother North, who one day tried to tell him what to do.\nInstruction yes, instructions no, said crow, whose zeal\nFor selfhood kept him this side of enlightenment,\nSouth of a tantric pass. Look out behind you, Brother North!\nBut no: the squeal of steel on iron rail. Thy\nCorporation come to steal his ministry,\nBros and sisters fled south.\nLet them in then seal the col, said the Raven Crown;\nTheir temporal allegiance is to me, defer to North on larger matters.\nBut no: good Brother North consoles his kin in every land but Middle Corp\nAnd this."}}
