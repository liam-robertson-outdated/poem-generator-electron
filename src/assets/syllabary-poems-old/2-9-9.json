{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A ship was breached,\nStern flipped over the beaked prow\nAnd beached on a lee shore.\nNo sign of crew; the coastguard\nBriefed the press and beefed up the night watch.\nNothing beeped or flared in rafts\nNor bleeped on the radar.\nThere's always a beat: your pulse,\nThe relenting tide, a stubborn\nBlank where there should be footsteps.\nAll we found on board was some poor\nBeast that would bleat no more,\nBleached and briny. It was\nBraxy and brawn with vinegar beet for tea."}}
