{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "With the winter blubber shucked, slim-hipped\nI hitched them up and in I waded.\nUp to the hilt in chilly waves.\nSome bad meringue in a bandit mask\nWith its dirty duster brood sailed up and hissed\nAt me: take a hint, it meant, or take\nThe hit. Was I impressed."}}
