{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The cam imparts an animal bob to the machine\nAnd from the noonday calm, each vine\nWill draw its own conclusion, each last\nSound will draw the full heat of the sun,\nAll a cram of self, a clam of death,\nBut nothing known: so near to am and om-\nEga it's a qualm in the deep,\nA shiver in the chasm."}}
