{"poem": {"title": "A Temple Guardian", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Cuirassed in education\nFired up and foreign\nHere I strike\nFear in the careful body.\nIt's a job.\nGive every moll her gangster.\nTo every shopping mall - a tiger on the loose.\nI once was someone's little boy,\nYou know. Step up\nTill I maul you good."}}
