{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The pack fanned out\nDogs toiled and drooled\nTheir noses trawled the ether\nFor a hint of fox. No grand sommelier\nWho ever toyed with blood-red juice in crystal\nEnvisioned the molecular implications\nThey took for read. The groom\nTogged up for slaughter trod behind them:\nToddle dumb kens tod'll dee."}}
