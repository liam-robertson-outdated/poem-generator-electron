{"poem": {"title": "Silent night", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The berrs were oot for the bells\nWhen Mary Buttn Benz (his face to see)\nCam cruising doon fae the Himalbergs\nOn hairpins, and shook out her hair:\nA squad of Buddhist bonzes hits the flair\nAnd begs a bowl of purritch.\nOne by one she beds them down\nAnd bends her mind to squaring this\nWith the Yogi bears."}}
