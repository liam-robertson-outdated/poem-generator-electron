{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "This blunt, late-Latin silver probe\nDoesn't draw but follows\nOr at most defines the border\nOf the wound to swab and dress.\nMacerated bandages, rag paper\nTears like skin the pencil bruises. What\nElse can you do? You see her face\nYou say her name."}}
