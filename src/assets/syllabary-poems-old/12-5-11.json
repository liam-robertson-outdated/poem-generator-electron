{"poem": {"title": "Jazz", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Feed a roll of paper under the keys of Dolphy's clarinet,\nWing it to Mexico City; let Nancarrow read the chads.\nHmm! There's more to Bach than meets the eye!\nHe jams that scroll in a mangle, gets his slide rule, awl and fid,\nJabs and jags at it. He's Henry Morse, he's making lace.\nSometime back in Boston Shreffler's stripping and assembling\nThis Thomson gun archived in a fiddle case.\n- Is that Shreff the poet or Shreff the musicologist?\n- Shreffler the both. On paper\nThe music shouts itself down, it jars and charms\nLike a rout of chav sopranos. But the instrument's keyed up\nAs a crossbow. Pull the trigger! See that varmint dance!"}}
