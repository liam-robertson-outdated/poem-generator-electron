{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "2/3 of what you need or want\nIs owned by nine gazillionaires. Their names:\nSugar-cane, Sugar-beet, Soybean and Palm-oil fruit,\nMaize and Cassava, Rice, Wheat and Potato.\nSoon there will be seven, each\nControlling one of the seven remaining\nSpecimens of drone.\nAnd all of them competing for your shite."}}
