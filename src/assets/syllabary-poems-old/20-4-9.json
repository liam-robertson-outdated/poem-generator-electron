{"poem": {"title": "Ecclesiasticus", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Lust wasn't him. He'd never\nLurked in puissant shades\nBut just lucked out, you know?\nCould call it providence.\nLunched with a visiting big man,\nLurched enthusiastically.\nLumped together with ships of state\nIn diplomatic channels he luffed\nAnd tacked. Tact, yes, that was him,\nA touch of vanity."}}
