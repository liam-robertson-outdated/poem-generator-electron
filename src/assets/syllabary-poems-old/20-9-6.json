{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The Roman who'd seen all the places and read all the books\nWas watching the husbands register young women on the promenade\nAnd everybody playing at never heed, when suddenly\nLater, the leaf he twiddled between his thumbs\nStill had red veins, and a green sail,\nIn all a hint of underwater gold. A shipwreck?\nEither he had seen it all, which was a drag,\nOr, well, he hadn't, and that was a real pain.\nWould the second problem solve the first or just supplant it?\nWas he happy now? Was she?"}}
