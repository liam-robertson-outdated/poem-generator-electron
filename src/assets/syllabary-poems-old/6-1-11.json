{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Frowns\nTo project his thought\nBeyond the bridge of his nose\nFounds an institution\nTo project it rather further.\nThe institutional thought police\nFouls up, though; roots and flowers\nPrise it apart. But then\nThe green fuse through which the flower is driven,\nOr green flues, through which biofuel gets sucked\n(Fumes of chlorophyl, some turned to seductive fumes)\nIn special feuds and battles over needy foods\nAre just this fools' paradise in fugues of replication;\nThe institution might serve us yet."}}
