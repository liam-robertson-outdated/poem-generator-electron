{"poem": {"title": "Adolesce", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "As we got to the first floor landing I asked you out.\nYou smiled and said no, you had to meet your cousin.\nI was glad you had a cousin. I was glad grey light\nhad moored the banister.\nTenements were sandstone, that I knew,\nbut I wondered what stone the steps were -\ngrey as light, worn as driftwood beams,\nas lips or shinbones I could have kissed,\nlike the lintel of a shore temple,\ncaressed and corroded by winds and visitors."}}
