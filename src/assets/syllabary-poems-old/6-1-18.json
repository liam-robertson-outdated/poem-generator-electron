{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Atlantic lows to fuel a big wind\nBetween the stacs - a fowling piece\nThat plucked them from their ledge\nAnd plucked them, propelled like birdshot\nFull into the outstretched\nNightshirts of St Kildans.\nIt's an ill wind, a foul one. Like\nAn old fool there's none."}}
