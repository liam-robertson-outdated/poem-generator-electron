{"poem": {"title": "The Contract (NYRB)", "author": null, "text": "The purpose of the contract is evident:\nTo allow the sex partners, and indeed the readers\nTo take pleasure in extreme sexual experience\nWhile remaining essentially nice, considerate\nPeople who have everything under control\n\t(Tim Parks on 50 Shades of Grey)\nAmmar's face is swollen; we see him strung up by ropes,\nWaterboarded, sexually humiliated, deprived of sleep\nAnd stuffed into a small wooden box\n\t(Steve Coll on Zero Dark Thirty)\nZorro fuck dirty, dirty fuck Zorro.\nA poliovirus trail goes cold\nAround Bin Laden's compound.\nBrave women get shot for vaccinating children."}}
