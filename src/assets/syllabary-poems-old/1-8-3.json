{"poem": {"title": "Ape", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I'd just come back from Kivu\nWhere I'd seen gorillas\nWhen I took my family to Basel zoo.\nThere was something I wanted to check\nFor a poem I was writing.\nA steady flow of people, a glass, a primate household\nWho'd seen all the humans and knew all the food.\nWhen I moved up to the glass\nA young one dropped what it was doing\nAnd ran across to watch my face.\nSuch a calm and amber-ancient gaze\nI'd never known, and\nCouldn't hold. I smirked and chattered.\nIt was me that let go\nAnd one of us sank."}}
