{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ghouls are rendering bone that glues their grander lies together.\nNext for Shaving growls and glowers, but he's helpless\nAs the goons move in, as the gnus (mind how you pronounce that)\nStampede. Nil Nisi Bonum sometimes grues at slandering the dead,\nBut they've no grounds for redress. He gowns up\nAnd grooms the judge. We're talking damaged goods, your honour.\nHis honour grooves to the beat, to the drumming on empty gourds."}}
