{"poem": {"title": "Health and Safety at Work", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Jute's not for threading needles;\nLances, maybe, in jousts:\nTwo bobbins like a fireman's hose (no knots or kinking)\nWhere one knight jouks and diddles death\nIn that quilted dobbin-to-dobbin situation.\nWhat the deuce!\nA king can make a belted knight,\nBut can he make him stick to apple juice?\nThey really should affix elastic ropes\nPlus airbags fit to mitigate\nAn epidemic of defective bungees."}}
