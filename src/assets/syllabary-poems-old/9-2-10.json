{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Warty sag that, when toed gently,\nClambered across the grass as though\nYou dragged or towed an invisible sled\nFraught with all you hold dear. Who told you\nYou could cross my land? The migrant\nHeard a toned and tuneless voice on the minaret\nThat tolled out rules."}}
