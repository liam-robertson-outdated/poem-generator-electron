{"poem": {"title": "A Viewing", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Winter clothes tucked away in lavender and cloves,\nCombs of tortoise shell from coves in the Moluccas,\nThe bungalow. The business. Yours for a couple of crores.\nHe cores an apple, but the crows\nOr rather rooks (the ones with ice-cream cones for beaks)\nHold out for pukkah carrion: the crones.\nNobody noticed till they'd gone, the giggly clones.\nOne that codes with knitting needles,\nOne like vitamin C to common colds, and one\nWho'd close the shutters\nAnd smoor the coals."}}
