{"poem": {"title": "In the Royal Palace at Luang Prabang", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sitting for Ilya  Glazunov in 1967\nThe Queen of Lao has asked and answered the question\nHow many divisions does he have?\n\nWas it she who was to die in a cave?\nThe new Lao royal ballerinas\nSmile and demonstrate the safety procedures\n\nTo which an ancient singer\nKeens an older coronach, and slips away,\nUnmarked."}}
