{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Two boughs of oak have crashed across yon auld fail dyke;\nSea-serpents in the foam, they writhe in their own leafage.\nHome-owner, there, can't get a grip on the garden hose his wife's bought\nAnd grasp the news broadcast in short-wave spray,\nOr he'd wonder where his boys were."}}
