{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Among friends or, later on,\nWhen ferns count as company,\nThere's something fends for itself or tries.\nIn firebreak fells, though,\nOn watershed fens,\nWhen the feds demand your fingerprints\nThink twice.\nKeep your hands where I can see them.\nThey don't care what you print. They want\nWhat you secrete.\nWould you please remove your hat, sir?\nThat's not a hat, it's a fez.\nYour phlegm's the thing. So spit."}}
