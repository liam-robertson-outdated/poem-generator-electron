{"poem": {"title": "Estrangement", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Milk jug on a tray, breakfast in bed. A polythene\nChug boat in the bathtub. Paper and paint.\nPotbound perennials in the front room doing time\nThen ugly surgery for him and our\nUnlovely adolescence.\nIn different ways\nWe all freaked out."}}
