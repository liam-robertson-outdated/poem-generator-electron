{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "They wrapped the squirm in squabbling clothes\nAnd laid him in a casket. One of those\nCoptic dugouts, with an icon for a lid, a wooden sim card.\nHis brow was polished oak,\nHis candid raiment as the scrim that held the planks together\nTo skim the waters of night and Nile, to sink or swim\nTo float, indeed, and stop in slim bullrushes.\nNone of which made much sense until the schism\nWhen mutually exclusive, equally plausible\nNarratologies were born."}}
