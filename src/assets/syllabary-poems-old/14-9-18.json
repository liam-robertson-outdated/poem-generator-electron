{"poem": {"title": "Campaign for Real", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Bellatrix in LCD, a pebble in braille\nFrom the island that recurs to me\nOn its own recondite orbit. In my mind\nThe word real that derives from the Latin word for thing,\nThe cortisone that will not let me drift,\nA missing line that will not let me be.\n\nGo grind some arabica; scorch it on the skillet.\nWatch the indigo dust on  the valley turn like a flock of birds\nReal rose."}}
