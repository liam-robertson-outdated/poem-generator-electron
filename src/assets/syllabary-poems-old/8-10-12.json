{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He knights the horses, pawns his queen\nKeeps a castle to himself\nDivvies the rest in equal, run-rig ninths,\nWaits till the knives and forks are cleared away\nThen tells them: nice.\nA bishop: - Is that timeshare nights or days?\n- What?\n\t- The square you're keeping: is it white or black?\nThe king just happens to have a knick-nack\nWedge of gneiss and knifes him. Checkmate."}}
