{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It's hard to regard an amputation as a plus.\nJade pus and gas gangrene. Starfish putts, or rather\nPunts the ball with his pirate crutch for a croquet mallet.\nThen it's the hockey: pucks and peevers sizzle across the ice.\nAs he plucks the hair of victory from a nostril of defeat\nTo puffs of applause from punks with mongrel pups  and junkshop prams\nThe strain pumps cramp in the pulps of his calves; he starts to cry.\nA fan plumps up his pillow, checks his forehead with her lips,\nRocks the pram some more and takes his pulse. He takes her purse\nAnd hops it."}}
