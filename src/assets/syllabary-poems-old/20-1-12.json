{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Loose and stiff, his fingers\nNeither grip nor lowse\nThe lute's throat or the louts'\nAt play in the close. \nHe loops a rope and lowps\nBut it lets him down,\nIt lets him go. He looks\nAround him. Yes! The wood louse\nOr slater, there's a thing: such armour\nYet it loots such worthless junk."}}
