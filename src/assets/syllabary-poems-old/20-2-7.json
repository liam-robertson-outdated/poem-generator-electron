{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Nothing loath\nAn orchid in a stone\nShe saw the look\nAnd gathered up, with that\nTinge of green bamboo keeps,\nA shift of - wouldn't it just be? - \nGreen silk. A competition:\nImpress me with a gift.\nSome brought her gold, you know,\nYou name it she would loathe.\nOne said for you I'll kill\nMy son. Well that did it.\nShe took him on (he had no son)\nAnd how - the rain like those\nBead curtains for a time - they\nWrestled. Ultrasound.\nHome, her mouth as if\nFlattened against glass.\nAnd he's afraid. She\nSits across from him.\nSets a knife on the board."}}
