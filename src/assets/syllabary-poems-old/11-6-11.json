{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"Fish market\" doesn't catch it:\naquarium with the plug pulled,\nwhite coats and whizzing knives.\nWe're on the skids. As squids\nAnd visceral squibs cavort around us, our kind\nSquirms on the slide. What leagues and schisms\nHave come to this? Whatever\nSkims the supernatant, slims into\nThe neo-biosphere and swims off.\nIt's such a swizz, this sea of soapy bubble:\nTwo swigs and you're legless on\nThe swings and roundabouts of outrageous fashion -\nOf or in. But somethings sings, and not just tinnitus.\nAnd friends: One slings a punch that stings,\nAnother strings you along and springs that odd surprise.\nThe whole species spins and weaves this vapour fabric\nOr skins the sheep it counts when going to sleep.\nSomeone sins - no accident, it takes a range of skills.\nHomo homini lupus \u2013 man\nIs an autoimmune disease the planet\nSwills and spits out or rather spills.\nAs the cyclone stills, you wonder\nAre there sills or thresholds we won't cross?\nAre there Mersenne sieves we've gone and blocked?"}}
