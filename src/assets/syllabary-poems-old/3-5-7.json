{"poem": {"title": "By Land or Sea", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Griffin, there is a path -\nWriggle to the middle of the lettuce, sleep -\nUnder the tree, wrapped in vellum sketch maps, it\nLeads, you follow, wary.\nThat angel clothed in the sun is just\nA boy, an oxherd. Learn from the ox\nTo stray from pain when you need to,\nTo stray from griffin.\nWatch for the drone that guards a hoard\nTo spend in India, where every year is the first\nWith a girl 3/4 black, 4/4 lovely. Thinking back,\nYou might wonder at a ship that you once saw in the roads,\nThe Finn MacCool."}}
