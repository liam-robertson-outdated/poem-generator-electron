{"poem": {"title": "Neuilly", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Un bisou, un bisou! A nous\nA nous, a nous! Just out of school\nNostalgic already; three of them\nPosed at midnight on a flower-\nPot balcony, just out of reach.\nCouldn't so much as blow them a kiss\nFor fear of blowing dinner\nBefore I won to the far from\nCheap hotel. Where I picked up\nKawabata, \"The Sleeping Beauties\".\nHonni soit qui pas mal y pense."}}
