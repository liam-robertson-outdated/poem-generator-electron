{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Crook and cook:\nSkewer and grill;\nTwist the rendering:\nPin him up and vanish.\nFor the shield-biting berserks\nLunch was the continuation of war indoors.\nIn Orkney, Rus' and maybe Saxo Grammaticus\nThe cook it was, with his scramasax,\nWho'd to top the innocent kinsman come to parley,\nThe Latin cook forshriven by the martyred Norse.\nReverse takeover: the guest was the dinner\nAnd the dinner consumed the host."}}
