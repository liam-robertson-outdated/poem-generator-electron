{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Piepowder courts in the shires and provinces.\nBlack stallion shies from what shines in the sly\nFace of the dustyfute pilgrims\nWhose shrines are carbuncles in piggeries\nWhere clergy shrivels and shrives,\nTheir churches being so many shives on\nWhat would appear to be empty bottles."}}
