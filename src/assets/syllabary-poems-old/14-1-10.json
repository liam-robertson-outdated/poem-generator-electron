{"poem": {"title": "Sculpt", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He roomed in slums. Rude to landlords,\nRowed about damp and deposits.\nShould have been a steeplechaser\nGroomed for use and proud of it, spurred\nAnd rowelled, never rued the race,\nOr mibbe a wolf. A wolf to climb the winter\nRungs of hunger. Ruined, burning protein\nTill the kill. But what beast was ruled and roused\nLike him, by clay to shape round and cut square?"}}
