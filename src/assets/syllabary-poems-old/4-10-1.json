{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Cow - my wetnurse! Land of milk!\nPackets and tins afloat like Noah's navy.\nSix days rehearsing the first word of Nostratic\nEnd in bits for the Saturday Irish stew\nFloured and quivering Turkish delight.\nChildhood ends with a shlook like school milk.\nNow you shamble among the urban veggies\nLike Abel's ghost in downtown Madras.\nWe're afraid to touch you."}}
