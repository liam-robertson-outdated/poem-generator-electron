{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Booze is essential\nSounds like a plural\nJust seeing double\nLike four boobs for two\nTwo boors for one\nFat Boab and the Broons\nPlay bools on the green baize\nBlues on the red blaise. The stupit\nBalloons. The readership boos\nAnd turns to the crossword\nA rustle of canvas\nAs booms come about\nThe boons of saturation sale\nBlooms in iron ingot\nGet you bigger banner heads\nI GOT THE BROOS or\nTROUBLE BREWS - my heid, for it\nSecretes a bruise\nWhere rhythm roots. And broods.\n\nAch but browns and blues are fine in fabric,\nBounds of gold, say, arabesque, or bowers of\nPleached boughs on canvas; the brows of brothers\nAs their freshest consort\nBows."}}
