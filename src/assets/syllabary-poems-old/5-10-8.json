{"poem": {"title": "On my First Sight of the Vine, at 21", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Whatever I might have pictured, it was not\nIn that scar-ploughed roadside plot\nA show of hands.\nHands mostly bone, hard-strained with sinew\nClawed the sun, as taproots\nInoculate rock. Amputees, no:\nAmputations of\nPhylloxerated emperors'\nWarriors, in whose austere respect,\nAnything but, I drank."}}
