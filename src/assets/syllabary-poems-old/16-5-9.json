{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A sneer glassed in a pub fight\nSorely gashed. He'd have\nGrassed on his granny. Yet,\nI grant, to be faced with graft\nOn graft - that's hard.\nTo get gaffed and hoist\nFrom your element, gassed\nIn the clear air like some dogfish,\nTo have gasped it before you'd\nGrasped the sequence - that too.\nSyllabary sometime\nYet can rhyme with celebrate.\nGaffed in your sheets, the trunk,\nBy this urgent gift, a blushing\nGraft, insatiable grant\nThat graced and grassed on us.\nQuite right. Otherwise desire\nWould've been glassed off, never\nGrasped or gashed. Never more\nThan its own ghost put to sleep\nIn chaos."}}
