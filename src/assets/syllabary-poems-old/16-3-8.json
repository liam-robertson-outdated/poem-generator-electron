{"poem": {"title": "Recycling", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The gong farmer deals with intestinal flora.\nHe does honk and hum but can't cultivate timps.\nWhen he takes a bath, you don't take it back:\nIt's gone from the flagstones and firedogs\nDown to the glaur by the five-bar gate.\nPig-iron groin, pig-iron gruntle."}}
