{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "He liked to feed the birds, Mad Uncle Joe,\nBut this was a midget basking shark on wings,\nSalty wings; its eye - the sun as seen from Jupiter.\nAnd it wowfed the lot. So he puts away his trowel\n(he'd just bricked up his bedroom fireplace) and he says right.\nHe gets his  gun (he had a gun) (he was a hopeless shot)\nWatched it fly to his roof and when it alighted, bang. No gull.\nNo blood and feathers either. They reckon it had had a heart attack.\nAnyway. It fell right down his bedroom chimney."}}
