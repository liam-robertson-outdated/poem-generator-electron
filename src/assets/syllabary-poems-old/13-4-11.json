{"poem": {"title": "On the Likelihood of Life Elsewhere in the Universe", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Shrubs in the suburbs haka. Glasgow shrugs\nAs a hyper-squall shoves it\nThrough the eye of some needle.\nNobody pays the piper, but we all fall into step\nAs the busker shuns the wind, heads it round.\nYou scarce can hear, in the teeth of it, the contention of the sirens.\nIt's here, so how could there not be life on Mars?"}}
