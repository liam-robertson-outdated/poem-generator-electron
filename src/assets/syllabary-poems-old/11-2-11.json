{"poem": {"title": "Eating the British (for Paul Muldoon)", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Into the blanket he stitches his sores\nCostume carbuncles and garnets.\nHis face is all craters and sockets.\nIt snows as he snores in his quilt, he's the man in the moon\nWho stows his feet under the headrest in front of him.\nWho sows the disease soars on fomite forty-one degrees.\nThe outside air temperature fifty below.\nI don't think he's well, you know.\nThis fever slows the sowers, boot soles stuck in the\nTarry floor of heaven, all chewing gum and silly spores,\nWhich roofs the random, psychotic settling of scores.\nA chaplain scolds the braves that eat the British,\nOne of whom stoves his head in as he strolls to the chapel house.\nThe frequent flier scrolls down. Sticks and stones."}}
