{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sails fill and squares empty, to strains and alarums.\nThe sales had just started. He'd stocked up on spares. Sprains his ankle.\nA five-year-old plays scales in an empty tenement. Nothing scares him till he stops; he keeps on playing, misses dinner, stains his flannel shirt.\n\tThus panic saves one little straw from the swathes that uniformed swains mow down.\n\tStaves and beats to the bar he stares as demi-semi-quaver strays tut-tut the plaster.\n\tThe slaves were better off before, their spades for graves not gardens now. One splays the forked root.\n\tRandom. Snail's pace. Spares one slays ten.\n\tCavalry seized in suburban swales. The captain who would kill before he'd curse still swears. Nothing sways the swamp.\n\tAnd so the invasion stales. Creak on the stairs. The player stays, head on the keys, till hunger wakes him."}}
