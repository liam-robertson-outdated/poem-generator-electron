{"poem": {"title": "Kompromat", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"Tvoim uzkim plecham...\" - Mandelshtam\n\nHear no evil spilled the beans and speak\nNo evil nodded till it hurt\nSee no evil plays a Keystone Cop\nIn Cheka leather with a riding crop\nTo punish bedbugs on some slender back.\n\nSnow melts away but \"manuscripts don't burn\"\nThey haunt the lots like trash from Tetrapak.\nThat cruel clip the poet didn't show\nWas lifted from \"La Religieuse\". No blame\nNo blushes: Diderot. Just turn it off."}}
