{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "They were trussed and trucked away for slaughter\nTupped with stuffing, trumped with a brand.\nYou wouldn't have touched them. We tucked in.\nAnd that got us turfed out, repatriated. Now you're here\nHow about this little tuft?\nHere, try it, trust me."}}
