{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The waitress - she looked fierce and sounded Polish.\nMenu, chalked on a board behind her head,\nLong as the queue behind me. To save time\nI said 'what do you have for breakfast?' she said\n'What did I have for breakfast!?!?' - 'no, wait\nA lime soda, to go.' What would I get?\nA lindenflower ptisane? A\nBicarbonate and lunar caustic shake?\nSee Brexit? I don't know about you"}}
