{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "She cared about him, which is why\nShe'd caged him in the cellar\nAnd caned his knuckles if he craned his\nScurvy head out through the bars.\nShe quailed at the thought of violence\nBut in practice it was not so bad.\nShe never caved in, for what he craved,\nWhat he was four-fifths crazed about was\nWell, you know."}}
