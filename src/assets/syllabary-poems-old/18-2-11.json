{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Turkic hordes gallop into history. Out of it\nThe rabble hones its hoes and spades but dulls its wit\nWith work. It holds its hurt in prayer\nHoves into song on Friday nights and Sundays\nTheir homes with hardly room for stiff pianos\nHoles in the stethoscope rubber hose on bathtaps\nHoards of vintage boxing cards in tins."}}
