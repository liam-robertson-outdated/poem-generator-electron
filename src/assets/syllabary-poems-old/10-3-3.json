{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A gravel drive, a motor park\nA message on the doorbell: go\nAround the outhouse, where the lawn\nSwoops down like a darkened cinema\nA room projects from the house above\nOne flock of yachts, a candle lit\nPavilion on a silver sea.\nThe mortgage owners never showed.\nI fled. It rained. Civility.\nJoe Pass, put down that guitar\nAnd tell me, if you know,\nThat every drop is counterweighted\nIn another life -\nThe one in black that ought to wear\nJust flame red, and not much of it.\nWhose every dream is sunk and countersunk."}}
