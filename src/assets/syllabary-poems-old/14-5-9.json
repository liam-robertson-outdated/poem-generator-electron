{"poem": {"title": "Easter Island", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Rat alighted at landfall.\nThe combers, at nightfall,\nHad carried the raft shoulder-high,\nAs it seemed, to the shore, where the rant\nOf the mutineers' shaman, the rapt\nInattention of crew as he rapped on the\nPoop or the pulpit and wrapped up his sermon\nWas the last Rattus rattus and Homo sap. sap.\nHad to do with each other\nTill every shell that ramped in sacred shallows,\nEvery bird or beast that ranked between them on the menu\nHad a barter value asymptotic with extinction.\nHow can I put it? You ratched up the idols and raxed for a dugout\nBut I'd used the last tree to cook lunch. It was good:\nYour mother's flesh sticks between my teeth."}}
