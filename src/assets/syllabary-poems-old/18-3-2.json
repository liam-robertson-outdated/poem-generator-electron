{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "A kettle was cursing on the hob\nMy brother was removing shin bark\nFrom the hobnails on his football boots\nIn case the opposing centre-half\nDemanded forensic tests.\nScrimshaw! he snapped. Boondoggle!\nI was wrapped up in my hobby -\nAnother replica from\nThe Clyde Model Dockyard -\nLook who's talking, I said,\nAnd regretted it instantly."}}
