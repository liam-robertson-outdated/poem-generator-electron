{"poem": {"title": "Jaws", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"Peking man, Sinanthropus pekinensis based upon about 45 individuals, males\n and females, adults and children, of which no single specimen is complete,\nand many consist only of teeth\" - Charlesworth.\nSo it seems they started out as rogue dentition\nClacking about in streams, where they got rejigged by caddis worms,\nOr castaneting corries in the Tien Shan to the OM of the aeolian harp,\nAnd things began to lodge between the molars - \nThe leg of a snow spider, moss, eagle droppings,\nThe bald patch of a vulture that had gorged\nOn a most remote ancestor of the man himself,\nAnd they sort of networked, you know, decay, and organized,\nSo that presently a bottomless purse was snapping down the mountain\nTowards the richer pickings of the plain\nAnd a muscle - more like an oyster, really -\nDeveloped inside the purse and well,\nThe rest is history\nIf only oral history."}}
