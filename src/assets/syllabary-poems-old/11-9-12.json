{"poem": {"title": "Concrete Sound", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sweeps in sneaks out or vice versa.\nOrthodontal squeaks and streaks of print. He\nSpeaks but doesn\u2019t say what good he seeks,\nMaybe a jeep, seats four on leather\nThree-piece suites to cruise the streets.\nOr maybe a negotiated cease-fire.\nGrey water seeps as somebody steeps and wrings\nSteeps and wrings. The plumbing never sleeps.\nAnd these ants in chitin crinolines\nRunning on their elbows. Stop it!"}}
