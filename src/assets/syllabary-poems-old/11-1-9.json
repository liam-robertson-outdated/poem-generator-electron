{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "No boy-scout, the corpulent quart\nIn the second-hand suit, sempiternally soused,\nHis snout in the red-eye and stout, his red ears\nA-quiver and -sprout, going round\nIn his souped up, re-treaded sedan. Go on, scoot!\nTime you spruced up your corporate\nThing: when's the last time you\nSpooked a wheen horses, stooped to recover\nThe Key at the Scene, snooped in his rooms\nAs the serial cannibal made his way home\nDown the chimney (the billowing soot was\nA Clue) and scooped a conviction?"}}
