{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "On the island of Poros, said Anaximander,\nWhich, Anaximenes thought, did not exist,\nMen sweat lard and the women sweat salt.\nShirts are flyped and scraped for suet\nWhile the salt, which exfiltrated\nFrank apparel\nIs gleaned in flakes and plaques to make\nThe amphorae they use for cooling wine\nTo drink by lardy candle light\nUnder the pines at night\nTo Anaximenes!"}}
