{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The spring migration slowed like a freight\nAnd smacked the buffers, bringing down\nThe snow's oblivion of fifty years.\nThe kites were here from Africa three weeks early, lost in peace.\nThey were the magic word that, by the weekend,\nRouted the old r\u00e9gime.\nOld ladies pulled their dogs from under sofas,\nHoovered them and radio-controlled them through the park.\nMy memory woke with neither shent nor shame."}}
