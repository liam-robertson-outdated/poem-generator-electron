{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The horse is gone.\nSchoolgirls tend the flame\nIgnited Nietzsche's madness\nHoists him with his own his own\nConclusions. As it all hots up\nThe wise man takes a powder, hops it.\nA horseless carnage honks in:\nThe hawks have it. Blighty is\nHaufs and hauf-pints in a pub.\nSnowline down to treeline\nWhere a chalk horse haunts the hill."}}
