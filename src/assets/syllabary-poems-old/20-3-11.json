{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Laws are losers. Brewster monks\nRe-route their loins for lauds in the night.\nOne logs in, nods off. He longs\nFor bed. Would that be lux or sloth?\nWho'd be a man of the cloth? The primate!\nLolls and lords it. Lobs his jug\nOwre the chapterhouse roof at tonsured lawns."}}
