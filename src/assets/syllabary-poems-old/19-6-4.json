{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "On a whim,\nAn Al-Khwarezmi,\nAugrim, algorism, whim.\nNo whinchat, stonechat, whin.\nThis Sunday has been put on once too\nMuch on that desperate lake;\nIt's warped and scratched and rainy.\nWhip it up and whirl again:\nThe ducks'll strain their necks and whirr,\nThe children whizz and whinge, the middle\nAir - whistle and whish.\nThe mountains do their best to\nCurtain the whiff of zilch,\nBut the merest which or whither and not\nA whit remains, abandoned hand of whist\nOn a liner, ice in the sliding whisky glass."}}
