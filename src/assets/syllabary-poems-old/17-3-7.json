{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Ah moff, zou art sick.\nA man has to eat and a moth\nAlso. If rose-petal butterfly silk is so cool\nWho says this moth is a black and white lispogram,\nToad in the throat, a cough in the ashes?\nCan't even say we're all cut from the same\nCloth: few are so fine and discrete."}}
