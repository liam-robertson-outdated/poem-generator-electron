{"poem": {"title": "McCarey in Moscow, 20 years on", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Spring is wiping itself on pavements\nWatch the diesel ice and slicks\nThe bow waves from mud mobiles\nFolk flooding down the lipid marble crypt\nAnd crush\nWhere feet still shuffle though the guards are gone\nTwo elevators dwindle up and down\nSynaptic trails have fizzled out on Gorky\nSt Basil's setting over that cobble hump\nMy shadow bigger than Mayakovsky"}}
