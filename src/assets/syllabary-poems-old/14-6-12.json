{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Serving writs by day and Led Zep riffs by night\nA body bridges awkward rifts in mental towns,\nWrists in stitches hid by sober watches\nTill something rips. Blue rinse\nIn ricks of bouffant hair,\nJagged rinks of costume jewellery,\nFrosty bard, the risks he never took."}}
