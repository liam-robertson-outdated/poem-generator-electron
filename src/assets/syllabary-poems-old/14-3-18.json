{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "It's as though the future expertly disaggregated things\nTo present us with each emblazoning its time\nThat we roil and remix. This would have been My Mother's Birthday,\n1st day of spring and of her 90th year (she didn't make 60);\nThat would be a dipper on a rock in the River North Esk,\nShuddering lambs dot the links above.\nThis is an old golf ball, found, like a poem, near the bank,\nAnd there's 30 years of peace and health and grandweans that you prayed for\nAnd even started knitting for, but didn't see. They're all good\nSo happy birthday."}}
