{"poem": {"title": "Less Sparta", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Poof! As the fluffy cats\nPounce. The mouse's\nGuts are puce, as usual.\nIt's back to epigrams\nIn the pleasure garden.\n\nBut soft! The sour-puss populace,\nUnwelcome to this cultural pitch and putt,\nThe poops and pukes of modernist allusion,\nRelieves the Emperor's Warriors of their weaponry\nAnd puts a real blade in the sash of the guillotine."}}
