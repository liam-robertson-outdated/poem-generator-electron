{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The craft that he coxed\nThe croft where he crashed\nGot corked in a bottle with snow.\n\nThe sentence was quashed\nHis warder got coshed by an\nAngel. He was free to go.\n\nBut the star's mum and dad\nHad rocked the wee lad\nIn a cradle too close to the wall:\n\nThey'd tucked him up proper\nAnd clocked him a cracker\nOr six in his cot - that's not all:\n\nFor Ugh the cat caught\nInfluenza. It coughed up\nThe code and then copped it. The bug\n\nCrossed and cropped a wheen species and specimens\nSparing one cocked-up, would-be librarian\nOf a race on which nature had just pulled the plug."}}
