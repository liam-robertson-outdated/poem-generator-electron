Excuse me,\nWhat do I do? - Go away and don't come back till.\nDoesn't get it. The flux of being,\nThe bloody flux, old bean,\nIs not amenable to algorism.\nThus the robot flunkey flunks it:\nNever will he butle or majordoo\nThe sherry-marinated pterodactyl\nIn Chandler. San Berdoo:\nSea fronts in summer\nRain. Auld frumps in summer\nSandals."}}
