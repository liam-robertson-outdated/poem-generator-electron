{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "MacDowell soaks in a source\nWhere the water fairly smokes\nEn route from ice to vapour.\nSomeone soaps her back, then it's several\nStrokes of budding birch or jessop.\nShe scopes the tiles and towels,\nStoats a question off the blind, invisible\nJapanese masseuse: who stokes the sushi train,\nDownloads that music, then sports with me and\nSlopes off at dawn?\nRemind him, on the wheel of being,\nLanguor's one of the several deadly spokes."}}
