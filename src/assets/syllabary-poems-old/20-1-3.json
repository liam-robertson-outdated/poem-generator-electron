{"poem": {"title": "Ding Ding", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "When rhyme is a loop\nAnd reason a circle\nWhen nothing at work'll\nWork out for the coop-\ner of verse in the hoop\nOf routine,  in the murk of\nLoch Gloom with the snorkel\nBunged up, don't say \"bloop\",\nDon't throw in the sponge at round\nTen. See, I've found\nThis horse shoe. Here, loos-\nen your glove. To the ring,\nGaun and land a good swing,\nIt's his trapdoor and noose."}}
