{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "I gauged the distance\nAnd gained momentum\nNursing a close-grained, wooden bullet\nStitched in boot-grade bullhide\nThat grazed the pitch and hurtled at the batsman.\nAll adrenalin - but not enough - he gazed at the bad\nBounce. The picadors hung around in\nBiker gear and glazed expressions.\nHis bat - a glade of willow trees, indeed - can't\nSave him now. He glared and whacked it back."}}
