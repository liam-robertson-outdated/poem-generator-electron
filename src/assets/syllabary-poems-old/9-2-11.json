{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The toads are in their heaven - one snug\nIn a gardening shoe. The Filipina's toes\nTrigger a shriek. Two flip through the cat door\nConjoined. One meditates in a bandolier of worms;\nTomes of exegesis bud in its jewelled head\nToo soon, too complex for its warty neurons.\nAh me, the bell tolls. its rope tows\nAn apprentice ringer off his feet, to wonder\nWhat troves of rhyme await us under grass that can't distinguish\nThe tones of the cow bell from the chant of the cow."}}
