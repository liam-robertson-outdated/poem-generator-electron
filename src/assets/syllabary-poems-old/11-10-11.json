{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sighs count - though what for, I wish.\nSigns are- they, like countersignatories, lose it.\nThe geodesic sines of pedals and the counter-threaded\nSplines thereon, along a wet road -\nThe cyclist smiles, rapt in ancient music.\n\nThe spine's relieved of its load, that bore you\nMy spies are everywhere, they know nothing\nSties and cataracts and river blindness\nThe skies are one inch from a head that doesn't see.\n\nThe way desire skives off a rigid self, maybe,\nAnd swives as it must, the self sheers off its body\nAnd strives to believe love doesn't need the props,\nIt strides ahead, of what? on what? and, tired of all these questions,\nSlides at length into the padded box.\nScribes eke a living off the dead and the bereft -\nA bridge from land to water, stiles on a stone wall at a cliff edge.\nThe dead are not a distant cousin in the States\nThough what they are or whether, without substance\nStyle's nothing. I looked out my folks after years of neglect\nIn case some short-range sentience - who knows? -\nRemains. Borrheid, the spires of Leverndale, Nielston Pad,\nArgyll beyond and rain that scythes the heads from raincoat collars.\nShe's gone, my dear, and that's the size of it."}}
