{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "That your nerves no longer\nGrope for yourself in the ground\nNow your parents gently\nLoosened your grip on the edge\nHere I take back every\nWord that was written on you\nI undo the consolation,\nStifle the hurt.\nI unravel death and history,\nThey my song.\nYou're a girl of seventeen.\nYour mum and dad open the door to greet you."}}
