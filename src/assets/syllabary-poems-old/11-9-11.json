{"poem": {"title": "Typhoon Nari", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Till aa the seas, till aa the seeds are bursting at the seams,\nTill water skis and waterboards at speeds beyond the schemes of man,\nAnd heavy screes slip up and groan, screeds of foam ripped off some printer come, quickening screams,\nWhen gutting it, don't squeeze the squid: you'll break its condom; squeamish\nScissors snip flesh. Now bin its plastic spine.\nSqueals, I say, obstetric more than coital, from next door, the audience steels itself, the sneak-thieves\nSeize the day as the rumbling rip tide seethes and rakes it in, all those white horses\nSlaughtered, as the typhoon seals the runway, churning sleaze and gravel, filling empty sleeves and holey windsocks,\nThe spheres this vessel steers by as she steams through that commotion;\nWhat salt sears, gunk smears to streams of fuel-oil.\nThe neighbour sneers and spears his wife again, in front of the kids, to further sprees of grunting;\nSurely her spleen's going to pop? The screen's blank, the wall intact, to spare us certain scenes.\n\"A good sneeze\", you want to tell them, \"beats a bad fuck\", and rush to buy them snuff. But the shops, it seems, have shut down.\nThe typhoon bumbles. Its little eye\nSees something beginning with nothing."}}
