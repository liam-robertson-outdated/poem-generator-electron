{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The pews are for losers, for old prudes and prunes\nEach galley slave moans and pulls with chained hands the ark\nOf the nave of the kirk toward the pulpit\nEppur non si muove. The nothing it proves\nIs the point. These parcimonious pools of light\nWhere janitor trout and dragonfly hover\nWhere plumes denote the male, the upquark,\nPowers and dominations, diphthong vowels,\nWhat prowls their periphery when prows are wrought\nWhile ploughs are worked and worked\nThe mortar pounds, the mortar pounds\nThe pools evaporate."}}
