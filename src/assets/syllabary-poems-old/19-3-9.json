{"poem": {"title": "Private Banking", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What do we want?\nA forty-watt ruby\nBig as the wart on this digit.\nA waft of chanel from that silk\nWhen I clasp it.\nA warped sense of justice\nTo fit what goes on.\nThe genie walked down to the lake (he could walk)\nLeant on the railing and watched the wee boats.\nAnything else? he said, over his shoulder."}}
