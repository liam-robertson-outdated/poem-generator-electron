{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "On the short leet but never chosen\nHe leeched and poulticed with the best\nAnd like the rest had not the least\nClue. They leafed through grimmories\nLeashed to library stalls in college quads\nOn land they never should have leased\nWhere something insensible\nLeaked from a catafalque\nThat the groundwater leached."}}
