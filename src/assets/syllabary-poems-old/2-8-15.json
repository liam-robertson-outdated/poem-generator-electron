{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Sanded planking. The walls\nScraped and just about\nStripped of any sign.\nDaylight then headlights scour\nPlaster. Bare wires.\nWires bearing power\nPick up every tremor\nAnd blare it back to bass;\nThey won't make much\nOf the hibernating plantigrade\nIn here."}}
