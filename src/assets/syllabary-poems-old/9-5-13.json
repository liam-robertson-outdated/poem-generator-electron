{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Three sisters, long widowed, the last time they'd meet,\nOn their primary teacher 'oh she was a targe!'\nI'd to look that one up: a violent scold,\nA shrew, a virago (19th, Ulster Scots).\nAre you not all ashamed to speak ill of the dead?\nNot a bit! We know\nThat she is in heaven's perpetual light\nDown on her knees, begging God to forgive her\nFor all the rotten things she did to us."}}
