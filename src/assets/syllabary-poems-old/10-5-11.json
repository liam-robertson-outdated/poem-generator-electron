{"poem": {"title": "Flim", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Rigoletto: De Niro dabs an eye\n(No drabs to do it for him: he's a family man)\nSean Connery drags himself along on gore\n\"It'sh a tough job...\" Heard it, Sean. Though I admit\nTwo drams, two deadmen does seem harsh when the Hoover Dam's abrim\nWith bathtub gin. De Niro damns their eyes, even Mrs Untouchable,\nWho darns bullet holes in her husband's coat and tuts at powder burns.\nAnd aren't Cupid's dards just like that? A darning needle\nWith a 12-bore kick. \"Junior! The radio says dad's coming home.\nThe dahl is cooked, and the popodoms. How's the rice?"}}
