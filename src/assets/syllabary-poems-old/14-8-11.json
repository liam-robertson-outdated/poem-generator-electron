{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The real one raves in dotage\nReigns supreme with drones that raze\nIn night-shift raids, on time-and-a-half,\nYour simples to their allotted ground.\nSuch are the reins of power: a title,\nA raise for dirty work well done.\nMachine that runs on rails until it doesn't\nAnd the rains rust it\nAnd the rays of the firmament\nTouch it."}}
