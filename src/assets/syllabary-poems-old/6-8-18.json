{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Assiduously fail in every thing you do; the holy drinker,\nVin santo, cantuccini. Roses flail,\nRestrained on thorn collars from candles on this terrace\nWhere I watch that grill till the coals collapse,\nThough one frail basket bears a spark,\nIts twindling bark, to the burning ghatts\nAnd pilgrims ferried, drop by drop, to a paradise\nThat so recalls\nThis place."}}
