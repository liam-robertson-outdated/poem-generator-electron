{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Though I am false,\nMy faults are real\nFlaughts of colour in the eye.\nStone fonts.\nThis sound foists a certain amount of froth on the announcement\nWith a lot that's very old and strong: frosts,\nFrocks - the pent-up energy of first, formal encounters,\nFlocks that enfold their enemy, cops in the crops.\nIt's murder polis, Cain or Abel, crooks or forks.\nFlops are neither here nor there,\nDecreed as they are by fops and feedback.\nI change my ways, but bear in mind: a fox is a fox."}}
