{"poem": {"title": "Bowling Green, South Side", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Crumpled sleuth, the track or tracker,\nNo truck with truth: he was It;\nNot there to soothe and say what's what.\nYou want smoothe? Get a close crop\nThen a heavy roller,\nPut whispering heat to the mangled shirt."}}
