{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Oh Wattie! Tango wabster wove\nAnd thirsty tongue to palate clove.\nThe wabster wove, the preacher practised,\nA warld birrelled on its axis.\nUnravel, dehisce and decline.\nIs there a second chance? Ask Scotty.\nThe keel was a shuttle on no loom.\nSlack, dehiscent foam. Knots and frames,\nKnots and frames, and nothing\nWove its overmastering ephemera."}}
