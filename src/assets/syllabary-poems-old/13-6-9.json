{"poem": {"title": "Temurah", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "S for Simon \"chist\" for pure\nHe called me stone,\nFissiparous schist.\nIt hit the fan, I left\nThe club. No, sir, I\nNever seen this man.\nShrift I am. The snowfinch\nSpread its cross above my head\nHrit! Hrit!\nRoll a die for the word he wears;\nA distant star, another hit: the seamless,\nThe seamless purple shift."}}
