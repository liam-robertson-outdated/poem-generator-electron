{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "One of the fans says, Hiy, are you the poet?\nI shows my fangs and says, How, are you the fan?\nHe says Mibbe (thinks) and if so, I've a request.\nThe train (we're on one) head-butts and hyperventilates;\nI reckon the driver's deid. I know\nI'm out of booze and fags.\nDon't insult me again, he says. It's true\nThat you have hard words to use\n(And nothing to eat but one of their sump-fried\nFlans, like chewing signal flags)\nAnd don't be rude. Abuse has a short shelf-life.\nFads are an 18th-century thing, like novels,\nBut the poet farms as long as there's earth to turn.\nAnd if I don't read you, there's nobody will."}}
