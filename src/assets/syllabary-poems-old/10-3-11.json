{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The dogs of Thimphu run the place\nTheir tongues like socks hanging out of drawers\n(Red socks in a blue wash, tut.)\nTheir pelts stretched out like so many Texas drawls\nSo many: the capital's been carpet-bombed with mutts\nMongrel dods of not-quite-there, their dreaming\nControls the flight of daws.\nGood karma: don't imagine\nIt brings you back as a prince, jacuzzi\nFull of compliant dolls and suchlike froth. No,\nIt daubs you in cheap fur on Thimphu's rustic roads\nThe holy mountain draws you out at dusk\nInto the ululation."}}
