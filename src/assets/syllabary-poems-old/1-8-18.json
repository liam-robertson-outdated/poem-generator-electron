{"poem": {"title": "God Loves A Drunk", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Her man came off the wagon (better jump before you're pushed)\nDown a flight of stairs. A fractured nut.\nThe surgeon warned of a character change and she said no such luck.\nAt the time, we thought that brave and funny.\nIn the boss's private ward we were whispering what\nAfflicts him so? What ails him? The monitor spiked:\n\"Did you say ale?\" Next day we found out\nShe'd sold the business."}}
