{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Poems never written down\nPebbles in the ocean's throat\nLagavulin's tawny shine\nClaret's memories of oak\nThat never took to shingle beach\nOr saw its seasoned rings would rhyme\nIn rosined ships, in reels of mine;\nWe're fiddles sunken in their song\nFrom peg to bridge, Across the briny\nOcean-o to Capricorn\nFrom Uist, garrisoned with sheep\nAnd two-and-twenty (count them) years\nAsleep in postcards. Out of the blue\nA curving swell will hit the shore\nFrom  blistered winds in ecstasy\nThat none survived, or no one knew."}}
