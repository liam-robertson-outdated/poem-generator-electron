{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "If it walked onstage in a pantomime\nYou'd all scream look out behind you\nAnd I'd say what? Look out behind you! What?\nLook out! oh that - it's just a pirate ship\nNo, sorry, it's a yak. See? Yank its tail\nFor a mug of salty, hot yak-butter tea.\nWhat do you mean you don't like yak-butter tea?"}}
