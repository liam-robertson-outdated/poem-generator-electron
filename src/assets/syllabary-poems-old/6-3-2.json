{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Campbell fancies Marshall something\nRotten. She laughs herself. Forgets to click\nThe seatbelt when he calls to fob off dinner.\nThe geomantic junta sees him as young and dangerous,\nBless 'em. She doesn't see the police car till she\nStops on a green light, then wonders (him\nSinging the praises of his wife and son)\nWhat this will cost her."}}
