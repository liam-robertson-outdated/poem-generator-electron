{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "What was it, in the tax inspector's water tanks and coolers\nPut some bunch of twats through a chemical trance\nIn the office car park. Under motor-scooter tarps\nThey quake: The tramps are after us! The ones we never subsidized!\nNow what can we do with pocketsful of rodent traps and tin tacks?\nSecurity checks the taps; it tamps\nTamps the evidence into powder\nTracks along the corridor. Of all the thankless tasks\nDetective work, I tell you: it's a tart's job that a tart can't do."}}
