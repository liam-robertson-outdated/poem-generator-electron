{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "The morgues are full\nThe air-con's out\nGo park it where your mouth is.\nThe maws are stuffed\nThe malls - sold out;\nGo park it. You know?\nThe morn's morn\nYou'll no can tell\nWhat mobile mob's be-viralled\nThe keywords of\nYour goggle search;\nCats, dolls, should I go on?\nModal arguments\n(Aye, right).\nA bull careers, a grizzly\nMauls; such turmoil\nIn the markets.\nSo park it."}}
