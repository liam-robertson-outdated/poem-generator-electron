{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Twin furls of cartilage. Clamp\nAn empty tin to one, the twine that's\nKnotted through its punctured base pulled tight as,\nWell, a slack guitar string, straining at\nThe can of baxter's broth I mutter into.\nYou'd sooner read the sine wave on a clothes line."}}
