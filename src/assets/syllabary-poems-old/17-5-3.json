{"poem": {"title": "In Tamil Nadu", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Eclampsia. Give me some light!\nThe body brown and bulbous, eclipse\n\nOf the tallow sun in the clean mud room.\nCramp, and the eyes are at maximum aperture\n\nIt's a trench, this, a camp on the Somme:\nBulls-eye for the ordnance of corporate\n\nCrapatopia. Last time, the husband cap in hand\nAnd the baby fished out like a carp from a pond.\n\nThis time - has he left her a dose of the clap\nBefore eating the pesticide he couldn't pay for?\n\nClasp at the dark, lady,\nA last twist of silver that held up your hair -\n\nYour molars still clamp as the next one\nTakes your breast."}}
