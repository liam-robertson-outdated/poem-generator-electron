{"poem": {"title": "Shipley", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "In drystane crannies snowflakes flock\nand sheep with stain of moss and stone\non snowy fells.\nIce makes dice from dalebones.\nShivered whins are fivestanes\nthe sky plays.\nIt rocks stones,\ncollapses crouching arches,\nin rage attacks the stellar slide\nwithin stone,\nand rugs at baffled, battled hearts."}}
