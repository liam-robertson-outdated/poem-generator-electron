{"poem": {"title": "Remember, Coot, that thou art Paint", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Couched in such terms we were\nCrouched and thumb-printed with smoke\nAsh and suet, forehead some touch-screen\nTo the priest, who can't write or own\nEven his sack-cloth and cabbage-leaf cloot.\nHis vows were ugly and a bit too cute.\nDoes this count? Towards what?\nThe golem fear was cowped; cooped-up\nWant was taken raw and cooked."}}
