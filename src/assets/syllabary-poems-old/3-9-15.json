{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "That slightly concave dip to the slope\nOf the boardwalk from the platform to the pier\nAt Wemyss Bay, a gentle gravitational\nSend-off on your holidays, its orientalist\nArchitecture up in smoke, a gentle push\nIn the swingpark from your faither, now your peer.\nMibbe the piles of the wharf survived\nIn brine. Buy an old ruin, rebuild it\nAnd use them as beams in the keep. On the firth\nPeer out from a turret."}}
