{"poem": {"title": "In Koya-san", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "\"Keep churches in the murk\"\nThe muck of all grasping fear\nOne drums up the flame the other's kindling\nIn the musk and smoke\nWhat could I pray with a Tantric Buddhist monk?\nYou'd better be on my side, brother,\nAnd that better be the right one."}}
