{"poem": {"title": "Bannockburn", "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "De Bruis and de Bohun: two brutes\nWhose grandfaithers squabble at meat in Valhalla.\nThe bloops of the bog and the brooks\nOf the bickering burn. With the armies in order\nde Bohun, mailed fist and missile ranging in,\nBoots up. The charger boosts him through his pawns\nAt the shirt-sleeve king, who ought to leave\nBut jouks the lance-head, stirrup-stands\nAnd deals the knicht twa beauts to the heid.\nGame over."}}
