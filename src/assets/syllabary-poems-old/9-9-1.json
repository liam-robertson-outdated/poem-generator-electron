{"poem": {"title": null, "author": "Peter McCarey", "text": "Twee is middle\nClass contempt of\nImitation beauty\nDrink the tea, not the cup\nKeep your eye on the ball, head\nDown, tee off.\nA man in the hard hat puppeted down\nFrom a branch he'd sliced with the buzz saw. Next\nA chronicle toppled on the green\nSawdust and resin, wooden tree."}}
